Installing
----------
You should usually just install the Jenkins Kiuwan plugin from your Jenkins
Management console (look under available plugins)


Building
--------

$ mvn hpi:run

This will build the plugin, grab everything needed and start you up a
fresh Jenkins instance on a TCP/IP port for you to test against.

Maven does have a habit of downloading the internet, but it's at least
easy to use to hack on a plugin of something.
