Apimap.io Jenkins Plugin
===

ðŸŽ‰ **Welcome** ðŸŽ‰

This is a part of the Apimap.io project https://github.com/apimap, a freestanding solution to keep track of all functionality a company
provides through an API. It is a push based system, connected with your build pipeline or manually updated using our CLI.

> **Application programming interface (API)**: Point of functional integration between two or more systems connected
> through commonly known standards

**Why is this project useful?** Lost track of all the API functionality provided inside your organization? Don't want
to be tied to an API proxy or management solution? The Apimap.io project uploads, indexes and enables discoverability of all
your organizations APIs. We care about the source code, removing the limitation of where the API is hosted and how your
network is constructed.

## Project Components
___
This is a complete software solution consisting of a collection of freestanding components. Use only the components you
find useful, create the rest to custom fit your organization.

- A **Developer Portal** with wizards and implementation information
- A **Discovery Portal** to display APIs and filter search results
- An **API** to accommodate all the information
- A **Jenkins plugin** to automate information parsing and upload
- A **CLI** to enable manual information uploads

## Build and Run
___

This is the Jenkins plugin, created to automatically upload metadata and taxonomy files.


### Jenkinsfile

The following is an example of how to use the plugin inside a Jenkinsfile

#### Default values (used if not overwritten when used)

The plugin is configured by default with the following values. If a value is not overwritten with another value the defaults will be used.

| Argument       | Default Value            |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| metadataFile   | "apimap/metadata.apimap" |
| taxonomyFile   | "apimap/taxonomy.apimap" |
| readmeFile     | "README.md"              |
| changelogFile  | "CHANGELOG.md"           |
| repositoryURL  | empty                    |

#### Pipeline as Code

The following example show how to use the plugin in a Pipeline as Code environment. 

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages{
        stage('Get source'){
            steps{
                git 'https://....'
            }
        }
        stage('Validate'){
            steps{
                script{
                    def result = validateAPI metadataFile: 'apimap/metadata.apimap', 
                            taxonomyFile: 'apimap/taxonomy.apimap'
                    
                    echo result.getDescription()
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Publish'){
            steps{
                script{
                    def result = publishAPI metadataFile: 'apimap/metadata.apimap',
                            taxonomyFile: 'apimap/taxonomy.apimap',
                            readmeFile: 'README.md',
                            changelogFile: 'CHANGELOG.md',
                            repositoryURL: scm.getUserRemoteConfigs()[0].getUrl()

                    echo result.getStatus().toString()
                    echo result.getDescription()
                    echo result.getToken()
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Build JAR

Based on Java the easiest way to build the artifact is using **package**

> mvnw package

If you build this component on anything newer than Java 8, please add the following parameter. This is due to a limitation in one of the jenkins dependencies.

> -Dmaven.test.skip

#### Requirements

Java version 8 or newer.
