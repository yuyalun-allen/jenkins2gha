# Compressed Files Viewer

## Introduction

This Jenkins plugin allows you to browse compressed files in the artifacts list. The decompression process is performed on the client-side for less labor on the server.

## How to use
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Add the plugin to the freestyle job</th>
    <th>Select artifacts</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="pics/first.png"/></td>
    <td><img src="pics/1.png"/></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Tap the plugin button</th>
    <th>Browse your compressed files</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="pics/2.png"/></td>
    <td><img src="pics/final.png"/></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">Now, if you are running jenkins instance in a server, you will wait a little bit(depending on the size of the artifacts) until the compressed files are extracted.
Otherwise, if the jenkins instance is running in localhost, the plugin may or may not work. IF the latter occured, the artifacts will be downloaded.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
