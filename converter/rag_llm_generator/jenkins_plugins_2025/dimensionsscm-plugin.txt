This plugin integrates the
[Dimensions CM](https://www.microfocus.com/products/dimensions-cm/)
SCM with Jenkins.

It can act as a simple SCM plugin for a stream or project, and
has some support for request or baseline-based builds. It supports
the Credentials plugin for secrets and now works with Jenkins
Pipeline jobs.

It optionally provides a build step to invoke Dimensions CM Build,
an option to lock the project (not stream) for the duration of a
build, and post-build actions to either upload artifacts to the
Dimensions CM repository, or perform simple baseline operations.

After installing the Jenkins Dimensions Plugin within Jenkins,
you _MUST_ follow the
[installation instructions](/docs/user-guide.md#Installation) to
complete the plugin's installation (by copying some JAR files
into place) or the plugin will not work correctly.

A detailed [user guide](/docs/user-guide.md), with lengthy content
from the historical plugin wiki page, and the
[version changelog](/CHANGELOG.md) for the plugin are also available.
