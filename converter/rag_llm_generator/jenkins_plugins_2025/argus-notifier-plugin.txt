This Jenkins plugin sends build status and build time (including queue time, build time, and total time) to 
an [Argus](https://github.com/salesforce/Argus) endpoint. It also sends system metrics from the 
[Metrics](https://plugins.jenkins.io/metrics) plugin. Administrators can configure whether system and build metrics
are automatically sent or not.

## Demo
So, you're using, or considering, the [Argus](https://github.com/salesforce/Argus) 
time-series monitoring and alerting platform and you also use Jenkins. Well, hey, 
you should check this plugin out to easily send Jenkins metrics to [Argus](https://github.com/salesforce/Argus).

### Configuration
First, you'll need to have a valid `Username with Password` credential set up in your Jenkins 
credentials. Next, you simply go to `Jenkins -> Manage Jenkins -> Configure System` and find the 
configuration for `Argus Notifier`. Then you'll configure the following values:

* `Credentials Id` - A `Username with Password` credential that has access to your 
[Argus](https://github.com/salesforce/Argus) instance.
* `Argus URL` - The URL to your [Argus](https://github.com/salesforce/Argus) web service endpoint. 
* `Scope` - The [Argus](https://github.com/salesforce/Argus) scope you'd like to use (typically we use a URL or 
conceptual name)
* `Source` - The [Argus](https://github.com/salesforce/Argus) source you'd like to use 
(the plugin will set this to `Scope` if you don't fill this in)
* `Send for all builds?` - Whether you'd like all builds to send build metrics (timings and status) upon build 
completion 
* `Send system metrics?` - Whether you'd like the plugin to send system metrics every minute

You can test that your connection works by hitting the `Test Connection` button as long as
you've selected a valid `Credentials Id` and filled in your `Argus URL`. See below:

Once you've saved or applied your Jenkins configuration, the plugin will go to work.

### Show me the money!
So, let's say we have a few jobs set up on Jenkins and a couple of them run quite a bit:
1. `concurrent-runner` runs every minute and sleeps for 90 seconds
2. `sir-runs-alot` runs every 3 minutes, says "yep" and then sleeps for 70 seconds

Behold, the Jenkins jobs:

#### Queue Information
Clearly we're going to have jobs queue up since we only have 2 executors (WHAT?! NO AGENTS!!). So, let's check out our queue metrics in Argus:

#### Executor Information
Let's see how those executors are doing...

#### Build Times and Statuses
What about those build runs?

#### Alerts
Of course, since [Argus](https://github.com/salesforce/Argus) is also an alerting platform you could set alerts for any of these metrics. :smile:

## Metric implementation details 
* Timings are currently sent in units of seconds for consistency
* `Result` statuses are mapped to numbers in 
[BuildResultsResolver](https://github.com/justinharringa/argus-notifier/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/argusnotifier/BuildResultsResolver.java#L22)
* Numeric gauge metrics from the [Metrics](https://plugins.jenkins.io/metrics) plugin are sent if configured.
 

## Plugin Dependencies
* [Metrics](https://plugins.jenkins.io/metrics) - used to get the queue time
* [Credentials](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials) - securely store your [Argus](https://github.com/salesforce/Argus)
credentials 

## Developer Stuff
