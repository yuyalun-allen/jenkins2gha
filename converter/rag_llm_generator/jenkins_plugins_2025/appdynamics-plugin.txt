This plugin is written for integrating AppDynamics with Jenkins.

AppDynamics provides detailed information about any application and this data can be queried via the REST
interface. This plugin tries to fetch the information related to a build, e.g. after running JMeter, and
visualizes it within Jenkins.

Many thanks to the developers of the Jenkins Performance plugin
 <https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Performance+Plugin>,
on which this plugins is largely based.
