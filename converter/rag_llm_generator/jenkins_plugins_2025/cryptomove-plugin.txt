# CryptoMove Plugin

You can download this plugin from Jenkins.io

## Local Development

```
mvn verify
```

> This is ran in Bitbucket Pipelines

## Testing this out on your machine.

1. Download Jenkins, on a Mac you can do so via `brew install jenkins`.
2. Run the Jenkins server, on a Mac you can do so via
   `brew services start jenkins`. After installing Jenkins it should be
   running at `localhost:8080`.
3. Package the app with `mvn package`. This should create the
   `target/cryptomove.hpi` file. This file can be uploaded into Jenkins
   configurations.
4. From there we will need to install the CryptoMove plugin into your local
   Jenkins instance. On the `<JENKINS_URL>/manage` page you can upload a
   plugin at `/pluginManager/advanced`.
5. From here, you can see the plugin by configuring a new `freestyle`
   project. In the build steps, you can see a new step for CryptoMove Tholos.

## Releasing a new version

1. Load the SSH key responsible for pushing the plugin on GitHub. Log into
   Github.com with the right account.
2. If necessary, re-clone the repo so other files in the `.gitignore` are not
   affecting the version being published. The only version should be mentioned
   in the `pom.xml` file.
3. Test the plugin works by running the following command

```bash
mvn clean package && mvn findbugs:check
```

3. Run the following command

```bash
mvn release:prepare release:perform -e -B -X
```
