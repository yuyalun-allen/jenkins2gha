This plugin calculates the following metrics for all of your builds once
installed

The plugin doesn't support pipeline jobs (contributions are welcome).

-   Mean Time To Failure (MTTF)
-   Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)
-   Standard Deviation of Build Times

The calculated metrics are displayed in a table on each jobs page
showing the metric for the last 7 days, last 30 days and all time.  The
table looks something like this:
