# Jenkins Jabber / XMPP Plugin

Integrates Jenkins with the Jabber/XMPP instant messaging protocol. Note
that you also need to install the [instant-messaging
plugin](http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Instant+Messaging+Plugin).

This plugin enables Jenkins to send build notifications via Jabber, as
well as let users talk to Jenkins via a 'bot' to run commands, query
build status etc.. 

## Installation Requirements

This plugin needs the [instant-messaging
plugin](http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Instant+Messaging+Plugin).
Please ensure that the latest version of this plug-in is also installed.

### Features

See [instant-messaging
plugin](http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Instant+Messaging+Plugin).

### User authenticated user for the command 'bot'

If you have a secure Jenkins that does not allow anonymous user to
build, you will need to have a user for Jabber. !build command can give
an error as discussed in
[JENKINS-15897](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-15897).  As
of version 1.35, the error is misleading as Jenkins complains about the
command syntax instead of unauthorized access error.

Adding a dedicated authenticated user for the bot could fix this
problem:

-   Add a new Jenkins user (will assume the username is *notification*)
-   If using *Matrix-based security* (Manage Jenkins -\> Configure
    Global Security)*,* add permission for the *notification* user for
    Job build, cancel, discover and read
-   Create a new global credentials and set the password for the user
    *notification*
-   In Jabber Plugin Configuration, set the Jenkins username to
    *notification*

### Debugging Problems

If you experience any problems using the plugin please increase the log
level of the logger *hudson.plugins.jabber* to FINEST (see ), try to
reproduce the problem and attach the collected logs to the JIRA issue.
