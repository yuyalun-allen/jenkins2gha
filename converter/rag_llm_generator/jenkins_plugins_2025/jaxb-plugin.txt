= JAXB API Plugin

This plugin bundles JAXB libraries, and is a so-called _library plugin_.

JAXB libraries were removed from the JDK in Java 9.
For a plugin using the JAXB API and built against older LTS lines,
it is designed to be automatically added as a dependency when running Jenkins on a Java 11+ runtime,
so that the plugin does not fail to link.
A plugin using the JAXB API built against the 2.164.x or newer LTS line
should declare an explicit dependency on this library plugin.
