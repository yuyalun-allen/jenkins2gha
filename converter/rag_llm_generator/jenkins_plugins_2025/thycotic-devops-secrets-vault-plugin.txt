You will now have the option to change the `kind` of credential you wish to add, to that of a `DevOps Secrets Vault Client Secret`.

After you have added your credentials to the build environment you can use the secret in your build/s.

> IMPORTANT: By default, this plugin will add a `DSV_` prefix to the environment variables. You should leave the `Environment Variable Prefix` field blank in the Jenkins UI when consuming your credential.
