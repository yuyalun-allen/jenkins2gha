# secondary timestamper plugin
This plugin enables the user to display a second timestamp in the build history of a job.
This is very helpful in case you have users and slaves in different timezones.
The timestamp of the second timezone will be set as a description to the job runs.

The timezone for the second timestamp can be configured in the job configuration.
