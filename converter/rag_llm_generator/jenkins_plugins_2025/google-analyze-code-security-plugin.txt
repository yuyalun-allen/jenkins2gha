Jenkins Google Analyze Code Security Plugin
=====================


## Description
The Google Analyze Code Security plugin for Jenkins identifies insecure configurations in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files for Google Cloud resources. This plugin requires Terraform plan files
in JSON format for scanning.


Use this plugin to detect and remediate issues in IaC files for Google Cloud before you deploy the resources.


This plugin lets you:
- Scan IaC template files (such as Terraform plan files).
- Display issues with their severity as a HTML Report in the Jenkins console after a scan completes.
- Define severity-based failure criteria for passing or failing the build.


Note : This is a Security Command Center Premium tier offering for subscription customers only. You must activate the Security Command Center Premium tier in the Google Cloud organization to use this feature.
