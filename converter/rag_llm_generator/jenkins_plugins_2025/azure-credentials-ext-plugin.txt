# Azure Credentials Ext plugin

Jenkins plugin to add support for loading typed credentials from Azure Keyvault.

* [General information on how to use credentials in Jenkins](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Credentials+Plugin)

It supports storing at rest the following Jenkins credential types:

1. [UsernamePassword](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials/)
1. [SSHPrivateKey](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ssh-credentials/)
1. [PersonalAccessToken](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gitlab-branch-source/)

The credentials must be created in Azure Keyvault externally. The plugin assumes the Secrets 
contain yaml, representing the various fields for the credential. Further information
can be found when using the credential types provided by the plugin. 

## Using SecretUsernamePasswordCredentials in the job (pipeline)

This credential is compatible with the existing bindings provided by the Credentials Binding Plugin

```groovy
withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'keyvault_credentials_id', usernameVariable: 'username', passwordVariable: 'password')]) {
    // your code goes here
}
```

## Using SecretSSHUserPrivateKeyCredentials in the job (pipeline)

This credential is compatible with the existing bindings provided by the Credentials Binding Plugin

```groovy
withCredentials([sshUserPrivateKey(credentialsId: 'keyvault_credentials_id', usernameVariable: 'username', keyFileVariable: 'keyfile')]) {
    // your code goes here
}
```
