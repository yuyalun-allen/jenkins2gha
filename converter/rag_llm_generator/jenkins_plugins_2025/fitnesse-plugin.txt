# FitNesse Plugin for Jenkins

This plugin can be used to both execute and report on [FitNesse](http://fitnesse.org/) tests so that they can be integrated
into a Jenkins build.  
Contributions are welcome, both bug fixes and new features. Just raise a pull request via GitHub.

[CI Server](https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Plugins/job/fitnesse-plugin/)

## Configuration

### **Global**

- You could define a JDK installation (not mandatory). All JDKs will
    be available in the job configuration.

### **Agent node**

- If your job runs on a remote node and launches FitNesse, you should add the
    HOST\_NAME environment variable in the node configuration and set its
    value to the node’s hostname or IP. You can name it as
    fitnesse.yourdomain.com (whatever you like). This environment variable
    will be used when you set up the fitnesse instance below (it will replace
    localhost by the content of HOST\_NAME).

Note: If you have the [EnvInject](https://plugins.jenkins.io/envinject/) plugin
    installed, Environment variables configured like in the image will not work.
    Use the EnvInject way instead. You will notice this by fitnesse still trying
    to connect to localhost, instead of the content in HOST\_NAME.


- You could also override JDK location used, by set a *Tool location*:

![](images/tools_location.png)

or by overridden JAVA\_HOME environment variable.

## Usage

### **Project settings in build step**

- **For existing FitNesse instance**: host and port where FitNesse is
    running

![](images/host_port.png)

- **For new FitNesse instance**:
  -   **JDK**: selected JDK, JVM args and Java working directory
  -   **Paths**: fitnesse.jar and FitNesseRoot path
  -   **Fitnesse**: port use and command line args

![](images/jdk.png)

-   **In all cases:**
    -   Target page
    -   HTTP and test timeout
    -   Results file name

![](images/target.png)

#### **Project settings in post-build step**

-   Results file name: the name of the result file ; if there is several
    files, you can use wildcards.

![](images/post_build.png)

## Result

-   On project page : a new chart with result trend and a little summary

![](images/chart.png)

-   All tests result in a page:

![](images/results.png)

-   And finally, captured details of a test:

![](images/details.png)

## Pipeline

The plugin supports pipeline the following way:

### Run your tests

With some sample values, this step looks like this:

```
step([ $class: 'FitnesseBuilder',
        options: [
        fitnessePathToRoot: "",
        additionalFitnesseOptions: "-v",  // -v for verbose
        fitnesseTestTimeout: '',
        fitnesseStart: 'true',
        fitnesseHttpTimeout: '',
        fitnesseJavaOpts: '',
        fitnessePathToJar: "/opt/var/fitnesse/lib/fitnesse-20180127-standalone.jar",
        fitnesseTargetPage: "suiteMyTestSuite",
        fitnessePartitionEnabled: 'false',
        fitnessePartitionCount: '2',
        fitnessePartitionIndex: '0',
        fitnessePartitionIndexFile: '',        
        fitnessePathToXmlResultsOut: 'fitnesse-results.xml',
        fitnessePathToJunitResultsOut: 'fitnesse-junit-results.xml',
        fitnessePortLocal: '8083',
        fitnesseJavaWorkingDirectory: "/opt/var/fitnesse/lib/"
      ]])
```


### Render results

```
step([ $class: 'FitnesseResultsRecorder',
        fitnessePathToXmlResultsIn: 'fitnesse-results.xml'
])
```

## Todo
-   Run fitnesse tests using "-c" option when starting new fitnesse
    instance
-   Add more control over fitnesse start-up params
-   Using glob to collect (potentially) multiple results.xml files
-   Nest Sub-suites and tests-within-suites within the uber-parent
    FitnesseResults instance
-   Allow direct URL access to sub-suites and tests-within-suites so
    that every level can have its history graph
-   Run multiple test suites from one project configuration
