# Chef Identity Jenkins Plugin

Allows you to use the Jenkins admin to define a user.pem key and contents of a knife.rb file and save it as an Identity for communicating with a Chef Server.  Then in any build job, exposes a checkbox to use a Chef Identity.  If checked, select an Identity and a `.chef` folder will be created in the workspace with the user.pem key and knife.rb files, allowing knife (or possibly other) commands to execute against a Chef server and have the auth credentials needed to execute those commands.

This DOES NOT install a Chef client on your Jenkins server, that needs to be done separately.

## REQUIREMENTS:
The minimum Jenkins version we're building for is LTS 1.554.3.

## Pipeline Builds
To use an Identity in a Pipeline build use the
[`wrap` step](https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-basic-steps/#code-wrap-code-general-build-wrapper).

```groovy
node {
    wrap([$class: 'ChefIdentityBuildWrapper', jobIdentity: 'my-chef']) {
        sh 'knife node list -c .chef/knife.rb'
    }
}
```

## TO DO
* Officially track these on Waffle.io once in Jenkins repo? Or Jenkin's Jira?
* Localize
* Setup FormValidation to remind people key and knife fields aren't optional
* Ensure the `client_key` has a value of `'./user.pem'` in the knife.rb file
* -OR- overwrite it for the user to ensure the expected value is there?
* Button to validate key + knife file on Config screen?  Will require external libraries/tools
* Use FileCallable for File actions?
