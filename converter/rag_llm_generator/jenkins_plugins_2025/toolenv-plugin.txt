== Introduction

Tool environment plugin lets you use "tools" in unusual ways, such as from shell scripts.

See http://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-4532[JENKINS-4532] for motivation.

Compared to
https://plugins.jenkins.io/custom-tools-plugin/[Custom Tools
Plugin] the advantage is that you can use the tool in arbitrary ways,
not just running an executable from it.
