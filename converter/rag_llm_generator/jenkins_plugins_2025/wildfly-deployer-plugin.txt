Development Configuration
--------------

Run...

	mvn clean package

...to create the plugin .hpi file, download dependencies, etc.

Run... 

	mvn hpi:run

...to start the Jenkins instance and to create the target server directories. 

Exit the server.  Run...

	mvn exec:exec@cp exec:exec@rm hpi:run

(The goals above require Maven v3.3.3 or later.)

Now test...
 
Installing to a Jenkins Server
--------------

The Jenkins WAR file must be re-assembled (or the expanded WAR file modified) with the following changes:

1.  Copy dependency wildfly-cli-8.2.1.Final.jar to <jenkins_war_root>/WEB-INF/lib.
2.  Copy dependency log4j-over-slf4j-1.7.7.jar to <jenkins_war_root>/WEB-INF/lib.  (Not required if using Jenkins version 1.622 or later.)

(Note: this is not ideal, but is required due to the crazy dynamic classloading behaviour in the WildFly libraries.)  

Copy the ./target/wildfly-deployer.hpi file to the $JENKINS_HOME/plugins directory, or use the plugin console to upload the HPI file. 

Restart Jenkins.

Now test...
