# seleniumhtmlreport

This plugin visualizes the results of selenium tests.

# Description

The seleniumhtmlreport plugin scans the selenium test results directory
for html files created by selenium tests and creates an overview of the
executed tests.

All html result files will be copied into the subdirectory
"seleniumReports" of the build root directory.

All results will be read from the html result files. In the overview is
for each html result file a link to it.
