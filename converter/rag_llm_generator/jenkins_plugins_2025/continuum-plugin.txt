## Continuum Jenkins Plugin

This plugin exposes Continuum commands that are available via its REST API as pipeline steps, such as

- ctmInitiatePipeline
- ctmPostPiData
- ctmSetPiData

You can find REST API documentation [here](https://community.versionone.com/VersionOne_Continuum/REST_API_and_Command_Line_Tools/API_Introduction/Continuum_REST_API_Reference).
