# phoenixNAP-bmc-plugin

## Introduction

Plugin allows Jenkins master to spin up phoenixNAP instances (slaves or agents) on demand within phoenixNAP, and remove the instances and free its resources automatically as they get unused.


## Getting started

**phoenixNAP Cloud Plugin** provides functionality to dynamically allocate resources for continuous integration tasks, and to bring up and down phoenixNAP Instances and resources as required to serve Jenkins Build Jobs.
After installing the Plugin, you can add PhoenixNAP Clouds and Templates with your required phoenixNAP Instance configuration. The Template will have a Label that you can use in your Jenkins Job. Multiple Templates are supported. The Template options include Labels, Hostname, Location, Type, OS, Credentials, SSH Credentials, etc.
After your Jenkins Job completes its work, the phoenixNAP Instance is cleanly removed and resources are released back to the phoenixNAP pool.
