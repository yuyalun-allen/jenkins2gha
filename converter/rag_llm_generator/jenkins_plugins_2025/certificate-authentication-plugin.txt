# Certificate Authentication for Jenkins

This Jenkins plugin allows for extracting OU and DN fields (or any fields
of your choice) from client-side SSL certificates for authentication purposes.
It is in active use at Pantheon.

Building and installing
=======================

1. Install a JDK and Maven.
2. Run "mvn package"
3. Configure Tomcat to request or require clientAuth in the Connector.
4. Install the target/certificate-auth-plugin.hpi as a Jenkins plugin.
5. Restart Jenkins (probably via a restart of Tomcat).
6. Under system configuration, select "Certificate" as the source of user identity.
7. Try requesting a page with a client certificate.

Configuring Tomcat 7
====================

In server.xml, configure a connector to request client authentication:

    <Connector port="8090" protocol="HTTP/1.1" SSLEnabled="true"
    maxThreads="150" scheme="https" secure="true" URIEncoding="UTF-8"
    keystoreFile="MYKEYSTORE.ks" keystorePass="MYPASSWORD"
    clientAuth="want" sslProtocol="TLS"
    truststoreFile="MYKEYSTORE.ks"
    truststorePass="MYPASSWORD" domain="catalina" />
