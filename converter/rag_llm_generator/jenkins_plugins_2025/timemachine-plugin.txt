This plugin help you track changes on Jenkins configuration. It records changes 
made to jenkins configuration as commits in a local git repository, logging author 
of changes so one can easily audit configuration changes.

Final goal is to provide sort of a combination of JobConfigHistory, scm-sync-configuration and audit-trail plugins
