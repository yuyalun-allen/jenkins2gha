# chartjs-api plugin

This plugin itself as it is, does nothing. It is jsut provider for awesome [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) library.
It allows you to easily use js-rendered charts to the **job** page or to the **view** page.

See examples in known plugin consumers for:
 * [report-generic-chart-column-plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/report-generic-chart-column-plugin#project-summary)
 * [report-diff-plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/report-diff-plugin/#project)

# How to embed
 This api is simply adding the chart.js library  to the view and/or project page see [header](src/main/resources/io/jenkins/plugins/chartjs/Chartjs/header.jelly). You have to first require it in your pom:
 ```
         <dependency>
            <groupId>io.jenkins.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>chartjs-api</artifactId>
            <version>${chartjs.version}</version>
        </dependency>
```
And then, eg. in your `column.jelly` or `floatingBox.jelly` you can use powers of chart.js directly. See appropriate files in above projects for examples. See https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/ and you should be ok to script it in wihtout issues.
