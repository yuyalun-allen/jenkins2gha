[Codefresh](http://g.codefresh.io) Plugin for Jenkins

The purpose of this plugin is to allow integrating [Codefresh](http://g.codefresh.io)  docker flow pipelines into your existing Jenkins flows.

Getting Started:

1. Define the connection to Codefresh in Jenkins system config (Manage Jenkins->Confiure system-> scroll down to find '*Define Codefesh Integration*').
This requires filling out your user name and Codefresh auth token.
You can verify the authentication by using the '_Test Connection_' button.

   To find your auth token:
    - log in to Codefresh and then open https://g.codefresh.io/api/ in another tab of the same browser.
    - Copy your token from the right-hand text field on the Swagger header.

2. Trigger Codefresh pipeline execution from your freestyle Jenkins jobs:

    - 'Add Build Step' -> 'Run Codefresh Pipeline'
    - If you don't do anything else - this will trigger the pipeline that corresponds to the git repo defined in the job's SCM configuration.
    - If there's no SCM defined for current job or you would like to trigger a pipeline for a different repository - check the 'Choose service to build' option. This will present you with drop-down selectable list of all your defined Codefresh pipelines.
    - Optionally define the git branch you want the pipeline to run for. If branch field is left empty - default branch will be built (usually 'master')
    - Check the 'Set Codefresh Pipeline Variables' checkbox to define environment variables to pass to the build

Once configured - the plugin will trigger Codefresh, run your tests and report the results.
On job completion a Codefresh badge will appear next to the build execution. Clicking on it will take you to the build results page on Codefresh:

3. Launch Codefresh composition environment from your freestyle Jenkins jobs:

    - This requires you to define at least one docker-compose compositions on your Codefresh account.
    - 'Add Build Step' -> 'Launch Codefresh Composition'
    - Choose composition name from the drop-down selectable list of all your defined Codefresh compositions.
    - Check the 'Set Codefresh Composition Variables' checkbox to define environment variables to pass to the execution environment.
