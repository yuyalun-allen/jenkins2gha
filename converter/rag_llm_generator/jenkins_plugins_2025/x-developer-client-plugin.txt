This plugin integrates with Jenkins the X-Developer - A Git Analytics Platform for Engineering Productivity.

## Usage

This plugin retrieves the Git log from Jenkins workspace directly during the building process in a job or pipeline. The user must specify X-Developer account ID-key in Jenkins global configuration, and define `TEAMID` in post build X-Developer Analysis job.

### 1. Create X-Developer account

Enter [X-Developer Site](https://x-developer.cn) and register an account for free.

Get your `APPID` `APPKEY` from [API](https://x-developer.cn/accounts/api) page.

### 2. Create team

- For free users, you could only create public team, **which will be listed in [X-Developer Explore](https://x-developer.cn) but only developers have permission to access internal reports,** we recommend this to **open source projects.**
- Private team is only for paid users.

Once you created a team, check your `TEAMID` from [X-Developer API](https://x-developer.cn/accounts/api).

### 3. Config X-Developer Jenkins Plugin

#### Configure global settings

After installed this plugin, enter Manage Jenkins -> Configure System, specify `APPID` `APPKEY` in X-Developer panel.

#### Configure project settings

In your Jenkins project setting, add a post build step, select X-Developer Analysis in dropdown list, and specify `TEAMID`.

- Check the box `Master` if this job is on master branch of repository, otherwise, keep it uncheck status.
- Check the box `Force analysis` to run analysis immediately, otherwise X-Developer will run analysis from 5 p.m to 8 p.m. everyday.

### 4. Analysis after build

The plugin will work with Jenkins build, and print the result of analysis service within build log.

### 5. X-Developer Reports

X-Developer will send you email when analysis job is completed, you could open report through the link in it.
