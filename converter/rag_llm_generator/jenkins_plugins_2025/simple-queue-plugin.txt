Usage video: https://youtu.be/anyGsJIa020 \
There are two types of moves: one up/down or fast way to top/bottom. The third move type is added in filtered view to distinguish between top of filtered items and top of all items.
The user must have an Administer/Overall or MANAGE/Overall permission for changing the queue order. (since plugin version 1.3.5)\
    For using Manage permission is needed plugin: https://plugins.jenkins.io/manage-permission/
Orders buildable items only, for that reason [blocked](hhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/56182285/difference-between-blocked-stuck-pending-buildable-jobs-in-jenkins) items do NOT have an arrow.<br />
