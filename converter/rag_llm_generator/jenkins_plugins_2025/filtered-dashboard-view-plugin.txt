==============

This is a simple Filtered Dashboard View Plugin where users can combine views 
and see the status of their jobs in a simplistic manner.

Designed to aggregate view status for each development team of a multi project
Jenkins environment.

In each project page you can filter your search on items by introducing Metadata
in Jobs for a faster visualization.
