# Chef attributes and run list settings

- Use chef\_json\_template to define chef attributes and run list. 
If you define one, plugin will parse chef_json_template data and stored result in file which in turn will passed as -j parameter into chef-client run.

- Please check out [chef wiki](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Setting+the+run_list+in+JSON+during+run+time) to learn more about chef json files.

- Chef\_json\_template confirms [ERB](http://www.stuartellis.eu/articles/erb/) template syntax. Here is example of chef\_json\_template:
        
        <%
            runlist = %w{apache::server mysql}
            chef_json = {
                :run_list   => runlist.map { |r|  "recipe[#{r}]" } ,
                :apache     => {
                    :version => 80
                }
            }
        %>
        <%= chef_json.to_json.to_s %>
