# gprbuild-plugin
This Jenkins plugin allows building GNAT projects with GPRbuild

## Main features
* Manage multiple GNAT installations within Jenkins
* Build (Ada) projects using GNAT project files (*.gpr) with the help of GPRbuild - configurable as build step in your pipeline.

### Configuring GPRbuild in your pipeline
Beside the GUI pipeline builder you can use the following in your Jenkinsfile:

```
gprbuild installationName: <name of GNAT installation as configured in Jenkins>, proj: <*.gpr file>, names: <Source files containing an entry point>, switches: <GPRbuild switches>
```

Only *installationName* is required.

Refer to https://docs.adacore.com/gprbuild-docs/html/gprbuild_ug.html for documentation of GPRbuild.
