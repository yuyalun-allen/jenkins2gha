= Multibranch Inline Pipeline Definition Plugin

This plugin allows defining a central Jenkins Pipeline for all jobs in a multibranch pipeline or even organization folder.

== Configuration

The plugin adds:

* A _Project recognizer_ for organization folders called _Common pipeline definition for markerfile_
* A _Mode_ for multibranch pipelines called _Common pipeline definition for markerfile_

Both have the same options:

* A _Markerfile_ that needs to be present in the repository for a project to be created for the branch in Jenkins.
  A common example in the Jenkins project would be the `pom.xml` file indicating a Maven project.
* The only other option is a text field for a Pipeline DSL _Script_.

NOTE: A common way to version-control the Pipeline DSL here is to have it be a one-liner that calls a function defined in a shared library.

== Differences from Pipeline Multibranch Defaults Plugin

This plugin was initially developed for internal use by the https://jenkins.io/security/[Jenkins security team]
while Pipeline Multibranch Defaults Plugin only existed in its https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-multibranch-defaults-plugin#warnings[flawed 1.x implementation].

While this plugin was released only much later, when version 2.0 of Pipeline Multibranch Defaults Plugin existed, it still has a few minor benefits compared to that plugin:

* No legacy code supporting the flawed 1.x implementation (as of version 2.1 of that plugin)
* No dependency on Config File Provider Plugin
