## Overview

BMC AMI DevX Total Test is a testing product with automation to speed testing development and provide higher confidence during program deployment process. The plugin allows Jenkins users to run test scenarios and test suites.
-    Note: The same BMC AMI DevX Workbench CLI version is required to execute as the BMC AMI DevX Workbench that supports the functionality of the tests to be executed.
           For example, Functional Test option for BMC AMI DevX Data Studio (Previously called Enterprise Data) integration requires Workbench version 20.05.01 or later, so any tests that contain DevX Data requires BMC AMI DevX Workbench CLI 20.05.01 or later.
