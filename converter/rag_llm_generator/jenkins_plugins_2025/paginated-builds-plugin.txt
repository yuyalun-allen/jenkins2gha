# Paginated builds plugin  [![Tests](https://github.com/jenkinsci/paginated-builds-plugin/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/paginated-builds-plugin/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

The `paginated-builds` plugin exposes a REST API endpoint that you can use to access paginated build data for a Jenkins job. Jenkins does not provide an out of the box method to access build data in pages — you can either get all the builds or the 100 most recent builds. This plugin fetches historical build data for jobs that have a large number of builds by enabling you to request specific pages of historical data.

## Paginated builds endpoint

GET `<jenkins_url>/job/<job_name>/builds?start=<build_id>&size=<page_size>&orderBy=<order_by>`

- `start`: The build ID to start from. (1 if not specified)
- `size`: The number of builds to return. (100 if not specified)
- `job_name`: The name of the Jenkins job to get builds for.
- `order_by`: The order to return the builds in (`asc` or `desc`). (`desc` if not specified)
- `jenkins_url`: The URL of the Jenkins instance.
