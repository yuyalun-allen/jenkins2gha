This jenkins plugin packages the stock https://github.com/kohsuke/github-api[github-api] library.
Normally library should be backward-compatible. 

== Usage

This plugin is a library plugin used by other GitHub related plugins to share the same libraries.
This plugin does not have any user visible feature by itself.
There's no need to install this plugin manually, although you want to keep it up to date.

== Note to plugin developers

If you are developing a plugin that depends on http://kohsuke.org/github-api[github-api],
it's is highly recommended that you depend on this plugin as opposed to bundle the jar locally.
Doing so (as opposed to depending on `+org.kohsuke:github-api+` as a jar),
we can eliminate the classloader problems caused by having multiple copies of github-api loaded.
Specifically, if plugin A and B both locally includes its own copy of the `+github-api.jar+` and another plugin C depends on A and B, it'll break.

== Changelog

* See link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-api-plugin/releases[GitHub Releases] for recent plugin versions
* For versions 1.95 and older, see the link:./CHANGELOG.adoc[Changelog]

NOTE: The version number of this plugin tracks the version number of `+github-api.jar+`.
