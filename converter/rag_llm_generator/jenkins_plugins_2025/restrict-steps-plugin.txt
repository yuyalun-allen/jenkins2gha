## Introduction

This plugin allows you to block pipeline steps from being used in any context.

Useful for disabling steps available to users.

## Known gaps

The following gaps are desirable to fill.

- It will block steps called from global shared libraries and user pipelines
  alike.  Global pipeline libraries should be excluded.
- User vars in shared pipeline libraries are not covered.  I would like to have
  admin-only vars that can be called from global library but users not able to
  call them directly except through intended pipeline steps.
- Declarative pipeline is not currently covered.

## Getting started

Install the plugin and add a config file to the global managed files of the
[config file provider][1] plugin.

1. Go to _Manage Jenkins > Manage files_.
2. Create a _Custom file_ with ID `restricted-steps` (this is currently
   non-configurable)
3. Give it a sensible name like `Restricted Pipeline Steps`
4. Add a comment like `Prevents users from calling these steps in pipelines`
5. Populate the file with YAML containing a `steps` key.  The contents of the
   key should be a `List` and the name of the step is each item.

Example YAML:

```yaml
# the following steps will cause a build to fail
steps:
  - bat
  - configFileProvider
  - createSummary
  - dockerFingerprintFrom
  - envVarsForTool
  - jobDsl
  - load
  - tool
  - withCredentials
  - withDockerRegistry
  - withDockerServer
  - withGroovy
  - ws
```

## Config as code

```yaml
unclassified:
  globalConfigFiles:
    configs:
      - custom:
          comment: Prevents users from calling these steps in pipelines
          content: |-
            # the following steps will cause a build to fail
            steps:
              - bat
              - configFileProvider
              - createSummary
              - dockerFingerprintFrom
              - envVarsForTool
              - jobDsl
              - load
              - tool
              - withCredentials
              - withDockerRegistry
              - withDockerServer
              - withGroovy
              - ws
          id: restricted-steps
          name: Restricted Pipeline Steps
          providerId: org.jenkinsci.plugins.configfiles.custom.CustomConfig
```
