# Amazon Web Services Elastic Beanstalk Publisher


### Master status:

[![Build Status](https://jenkins.ci.cloudbees.com/buildStatus/icon?job=plugins/aws-beanstalk-publisher-plugin)](https://jenkins.ci.cloudbees.com/job/plugins/job/aws-beanstalk-publisher-plugin/)


This plugin allows for publishing to an Elastic Beanstalk application as either a Build or Post Build step.  

Amazon credentials are set in the global configuration.  
IAM credentials need to be able to read and upload to S3, and to read and configure Elastic Beanstalk.

#### Example Credentials
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "elasticbeanstalk:*",
        "s3:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

After adding the Access Key ID and Secret Key in to the Jenkins master configuration, click Advanced and choose a region to see what applications your credentials actually see.

The Access Key and Secret Key are optional.  Credentials can be placed in the master configuration, in a .aws config file, or as environment variables.

If Jenkins is itself running inside AWS (for example on an EC2 instance) you can instead leave the Access Key ID and Secret Key blank, and the IAM instance role of the jenkins server will be used for authentication.

More about AWS credentials can be found [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSdkDocsJava/latest/DeveloperGuide/credentials.html).
