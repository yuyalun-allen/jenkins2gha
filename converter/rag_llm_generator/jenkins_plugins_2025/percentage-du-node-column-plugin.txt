Motivation
==========

Jenkins does provide some basic monitoring and I need to have some extra information in order to monitor whether a particular
slave is exhausted based on another metrics in order to run another processes.


TODO
====

- Add Threshold check.
- Add Test Cases.


Development
===========

Start the local Jenkins instance:

    mvn hpi:run


How to install
--------------

Run

	mvn clean package

to create the plugin .hpi file.


To install:

1. copy the resulting ./target/percentagecolumn.hpi file to the $JENKINS_HOME/plugins directory. Don't forget to restart Jenkins afterwards.

2. or use the plugin management console (http://example.com:8080/pluginManager/advanced) to upload the hpi file. You have to restart Jenkins in order to find the plugin in the installed plugins list.


Plugin releases
