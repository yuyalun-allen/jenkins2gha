jenkins-build-with-parameters-plugin
====================================

Allows the user to provide parameters for a build in the url, prompting for confirmation before triggering the job.

The plugin exposes `$JENKINS/job/$JOB/parambuild` url to trigger the build with parameter.
Unlike `$JENKINS/job/$JOB/buildWithParameters`, a human must confirm that the parameters are correct before the build is triggered.
This is useful if you want to create a list of jobs with parameters to trigger ahead of time, and execute it at some future date (e.g. a deployment plan).
