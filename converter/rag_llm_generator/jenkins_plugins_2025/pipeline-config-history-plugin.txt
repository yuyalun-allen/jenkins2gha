This Plugin tracks changes in your pipeline configuration on a build
basis (including replay builds):  
On each completed build built from a pipeline config (including
libraries) which differs from the latest history entry, a new history
entry is created.

**These information are stored:**

-   The Jenkinsfile (or the pipeline script if you're not using pipeline
    via scm)
-   Globally shared libraries
-   Shared Libraries accessible to the folder your pipeline might be
    included in.

The single configurations are viewable file-by-file with each file being
downloadable.

You can also easily compare pipeline changes between two builds with a
file-wise or all-in-one side-by-side or line-under-line diff view.  
Restoring old configurations however is not possible, since that would
require a modification in your Jenkinsfile and/ or library scm.
