Jenkins Cluster Statistics
=============

Motivation
-----

Every now and then your Jenkins cluster will get slow for the users. Usually this happens because of the increase in utilization due to added projects, team members or added supported platforms. Then starts whining. Cluster is slow, not enough executors, long builds etc. From higher up it is difficult to assess if we need more computing power or less whining. Hence, Jenkins Cluster Statistics Plugin was conceived.

The plugin will measure the time in queue, time in build and show these statistics per node. Hopefully this will give you an indication if you need to invest in more Jenkins nodes. Want more statistics? Download the data in CSV format and run your own analysis in Excel.
