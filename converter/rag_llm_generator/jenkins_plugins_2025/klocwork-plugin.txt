#### Version 2.5.2
* General Update: switched pom.xml to use jenkins https. This change does not impact existing configuration or behaviour. 

#### Version 2.5.1
* Bug Fix: Resolved issue where the diff analysis command line is too long.  The diff file is now passed as an argument file, rather than each file on the command line. Also skipped the check internally between the diff file and the build specification as kwciagent does this itself and also provides output to skipped files. This change does not impact existing configuration or behaviour. 

#### Version 2.5.0
* Feature: Added option to the advanced section of the integration analysis step, that if the specified project does not exist it will be created or duplicated from another. This change does not impact existing configuration or behaviour (off by default), however to make use of the new feature extra pipeline configuration or GUI configuration is needed. 

#### Version 2.4.9
* Bug Fix: Update to resolve issue with the Klocwork server url links. Projects with special characters such as spaces or projects that had been renamed would generate invalid url links. No impact or change to configuration should be needed.

#### Version 2.4.8
* Bug Fix: Update to resolve issue with severities in Japanese language. No impact or change to configuration should be needed.

#### Version 2.4.7
* Bug Fix: Resolved issue introduced in 2.4.6 where global server/install settings were not being saved. No impact or change to configuration should be needed.
* Bug Fix: Resolved issue where the trend graph and Klocwork link introduced in 2.4.3 were not showing in pipeline jobs. No impact or change to configuration should be needed.
* Bug Fix: Resolved issue when generating a pipeline snippet on step 'klocworkIntegrationStep2'. No impact or change to configuration should be needed.

#### Version 2.4.6
* Feature: Added the ability to use with jcasc plugin. No impact or change to configuration should be needed.

#### Version 2.4.5
* Bug Fix: Resolved issue in which when reading the ltoken file the resource was not closed. No impact or change to configuration should be needed.

#### Version 2.4.4
* Bug Fix: Post-build step "Klocwork Gateway". The query string sent to the server was being incorrectly formatted due to errors in the code. No impact or change to configuration should be needed.

#### Version 2.4.3
* New feature: Added trend graph and link to Klocwork review to the main product page. Configuration can be found in the integration step for loading. This does impact pipeline configuration
* Important note: This version requires an update to the pipeline scripts running integration builds to continue to run. Please find examples below:

Pipeline before 2.4.3:

    klocworkIntegrationStep2 ( [ tablesDir: "${KLOCWORK_TABLES}", buildName: "", additionalOpts: "" ])

Pipeline 2.4.3 without trend chart:

    klocworkIntegrationStep2 (
                serverConfig:[
                    tablesDir: "${KLOCWORK_TABLES}",
                    buildName: "",
                    additionalOpts: ""
                ]
    )

Pipeline 2.4.3 with trend chart:

    klocworkIntegrationStep2 (
                serverConfig:[
                    tablesDir: "${KLOCWORK_TABLES}", 
                    buildName: "", 
                    additionalOpts: "" 
                ],
                reportConfig:[
                   displayChart: true,
                   chartHeight: "",
                   chartWidth: "",
                   query: "status:Analyze"
               ]
     )
