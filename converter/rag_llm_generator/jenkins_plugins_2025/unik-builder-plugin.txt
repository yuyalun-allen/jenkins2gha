# Unik Builder Plugin

This plugin allows to add different Unik command as build steps to your freestyle and pipeline jobs as build steps. 

Unik is a build framework that simplifies the build and execution of Unikernel instances (https://github.com/solo-io/unik).

# Commands

The commands currently supported are:

* create an image
* delete an image
* pull an image from a registry
* push an image to a registry 
* run a new instance
* start an existing instance
* stop a running instance
* delete an instance
* create a volume
* attach a volume
* detach a volume
* delete a volume

## Example Usage

In the fallowing we pull an image from a repository and run it, both as a freestyle job an as a pipeline job.

### Freestyle Job

### Pipeline Job

````
node{
    unik pull(imageName: 'myImage', provider: 'virtualbox', unikHubEndpoint: hub(credentialsId: 'hubCredentialsID', url: 'http://myunik.hub.com/'))
    unik run(imageName: 'myImage', instanceName: 'myInstance')
}

Additionally we can globally configure both a default location for the Unik deamon and a default location for a Unik Hub.
