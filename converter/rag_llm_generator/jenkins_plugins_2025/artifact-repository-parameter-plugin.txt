The goal of the plugin is to make certain information of an artifact repository available as
[Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) build parameter. Currently the following endpoints are supported.

* __Path__ - Display all deployed artifacts by its path.
* __Version__ - Display all available versions of an artifact.
* __Repositories__ - A list of all available repositories.

The following artifact repositories have been tested during development.

* __Sonatype Nexus 3 OSS - 3.42.0-01__
* __JFrog Artifactory Cloud__
* __JFrog Artifactory 7 OSS - 7.41.13__

> When someone has access to other versions of Nexus/Artifactory it would be nice to
> get some feedback whether it's working fine with these versions or not.

## Version Warning

Please be aware that version 2.0.0 is not backwards compatible to version 1.x. There is a
breaking change in the `Display Options` section. All results are now displayed in a select
box. The option to display the results as a dropdown, radio button or checkbox have been
removed. If multiple results must be selectable please make sure to check the
`Multiple Entries Selectable` option.

Furthermore the support for Java 8 was dropped. This plugin now requires Java 11 or higher.

Last but not least the plugin is based on Jenkins LTS version 2.361.2 or higher.
