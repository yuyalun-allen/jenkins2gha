# View-cloner
This plugin allows to copy and change view AND jobs assigned to it in a bulk.

# Description
Plugin adds a build step that allows to specify a view (Nested and Sectioned views are supported) and a replacement pattern to use when copying and reconfiguring the jobs.

Expected result after the build step successfully executes are:
* ** Original view and jobs assigned to it are left untouched **
* New view is created _next_ to original view, structure of the view is preserved, assigned jobs are changed to the newly created ones.
* Jobs assigned to the original view get copied after their names and configurations undergo a replacement.
* If when creating a new job , job name is already taken, creation of that particular job is skipped.
