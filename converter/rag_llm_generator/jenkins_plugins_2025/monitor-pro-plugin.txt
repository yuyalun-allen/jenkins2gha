By default, Monitor Pro tries to connect to Jenkins at http://localhost:8080/jenkins, if we have cofigurated Jenkins on another port or basepath, we need to set the correct value in the configuration menu. Remember that Monitor Pro runs on Jenkis, so it is not to set any user or password. You only need to fill in these filds if you run Monitor Pro on another web application or if you want monitoring another jenkins server.

# Technology
  The interface and logic of Monitor Pro, are built entirely with the Angular Framework and TypeScript. Jelly, Stapler or Java, are only used to integrate the application as a plugin on jenkins. Monitor Pro obtains job status information by making requests to the Jenkins REST API..
