# Link Column plugin for Jenkins


## Purpose

This is a plugin for the [Jenkins CI server](https://jenkins.io) which provides additional custom link column in the main UI screen.
It's using the [listview-column extension](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Extension+points#Extensionpoints-hudson.views.ListViewColumn).

## Usage

* Create a new view by clicking on the "+" tab, select list view as type and name it. At the bottom of the configuration page of the new view you can select custom link in the "Add column" dropdown list.
* If you want to add columns to the All view, follow the guide on the [Editing or Replacing the All View wiki page](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Editing+or+Replacing+the+All+View).
