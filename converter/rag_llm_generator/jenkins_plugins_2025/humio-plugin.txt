# Humio Plugin for Jenkins

This plugin will automatically ship all build logs to Humio.

## Usage

Go to `Manage Jenkins` -> `Global Configuration` and find the Humio section.
You will need to put in the `repositoryId` and an ingest token you have created
in Humio for `repositoryName`.
You can create an ingest token under the settings page of your repository.

## Installation

Build the HPI package using:

```shell
mvn package
```

Upload the `hpi` file from the target directory to Jenkins,
under `Plugins` > `Advanced`.


## Developing on this plugin

Use the `hpi:run` maven task to start a Jenkins locally with
the plugin enabled.
