# CloudBees Feature Management Jenkins Plugin

This plugin integrates with your https://app.rollout.io[CloudBees Feature Management] organization and allows you to view your feature flag configuration at build-time and view any changes between previous builds. This allows you to easily determine whether any flag changes have caused build failures.

The plugin adds a build step that will download and store your flag configurations for a configured CloudBees Feature Management application/environment. It allows you to inspect the configuration and view a detailed difference and log of any changes between a build and the previous successful build.
