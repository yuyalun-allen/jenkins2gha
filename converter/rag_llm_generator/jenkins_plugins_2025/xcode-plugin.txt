*Important!*

Newesth version is compatibility with the previous version priour 2.0.12 is maintained.
However, major changes have been made to the handling of macOS
keychains.

Information to access the keychain is moved from configuration to
credentials.  
After that, the information for accessing the keychain must be
registered in the credentials.

This plugin adds the ability to call Xcode command line tools to
automate build and packaging iOS applications (iPhone, iPad, ...).

#### Features

##### Versioning

This builder can invoke agvtool to dynamically update the
`CFBundleVersion` (a.k.a. Technical Version) or
`CFBundleShortVersionString` (a.k.a. Marketing Version). It supports all
macros from the . For example the value `${BUILD_NUMBER`} will be
replaced with the current build number. We advice you to generate a
unique value for each build for the `CFBundleVersion` if you want for
example deploy it into a private store. In that case you can use for
example : `${JOB_NAME}-${BUILD_NUMBER`}

##### Building

The target (optional), configuration (e.g. `Debug`, `Release`) and SDK
(optional) can be specified in the per-project config along with whether
to perform a clean before the build phase.

##### Packaging

The builder can be used to package the .app into a .ipa. Since a .app is
actually a directory, it can be awkward to work with and, especially,
distribute. We can simplify this by packaging the .app into a single
.ipa file, which is just a  
zip file with a well-known internal structure

##### Signing

This plugin has two features that help you simplify the code signing
process.

###### Allowing Jenkins to stage developer profile

This plugin builds on top of to allow you to store your Apple Developer
Profile (\*.developerprofile) file. [This file contains a code signing
private key, corresponding developer/distribution certificates, and
mobile provisioning
profiles](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15154211/what-data-are-stored-in-developer-profile-file-exported-from-xcode).
You can [create this file from your
XCode](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10404931/copying-keys-and-certificates-to-another-one-mac-for-iphone-development).

To upload the developer profile into Jenkins, go to "Manage Credentials"
in the system configuration page, and select "Apple Developer Profile"
from the "Add" button. See for further details.

To use this profile for signing, add "Import developer profile" as a
build step before you run xcode, and select the developer profile to
import into the build machine. This build step will install the
developer profile into the slave's keychain.

###### Work with existing populated keychains

If you create a dedicated keychain that stores the code signing private
key and certificate on every build slave, you can configure the plugin
to just unlock this keychain (so that xcode can use it for signing)

Unlocking

If you store your keys in the user keychain (most probably) and if you
run jenkins as daemon, make sure you installed a recent version of
jenkins for Mac, or configured the daemon to create a session (through
the CreationSession=true parameter in your org.jenkins-ci.plist daemon
config file). [See
also](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9626447/unable-to-sign-ios-builds-with-jenkins)

Timeouts

The keychain has a default timeout of 300 seconds. One can override it
using the security set-keychain-settings command, which isn't supported
in the plugin today. Support in the plugin could be improved by adding
options to modify the timeout as part of the build process. See
[JENKINS-17184](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-17184).

##### Unit Testing

This plugin will listen to the xcodebuild output when running OCUnit or
XC tests and write out JUnit-format test reports that Jenkins can
understand. Jenkins will then use these to publish test failure reports
and graphs.

##### Sample of the configuration panel

#### Documentation

##### Installation guide

Obviously, the build machine has to be an OSX machine with XCode
developer tools installed.  
Certificates, Identities and Provisions must be installed on the build
machine separately.  
Just install the latest version of the plugin from the update center and
configure a freestyle job (see \#Usage Guide) that will use your OSX
node (If your central instance isn't running under OSX).  
If xcode related binaries aren't stored in the default location, update
the global configuration of the plugin (Manage Jenkins -\> Configure
System)  
![](docs/images/46781a5731ff4fb8b72f4d780b2b02a402f34a2e.png)

If you want to use multiple versions of Xcode to build your application,
use ’Global Tool Configuration’ to register the distinguished name and
location of the installed Xcode.

##### Usage guide

###### Import developer profile step

By adding the Import developer profile step to Build, you can import
developer profiles exported to Xcode into temporary keychains or
existing keychains.  
The developer profile contains a set of certificates, secret keys and
provisioning profiles necessary for compiling and signing applications,
which is useful for distributing with multiple Jenkins nodes.

Limitations

The Xcode Integration Plugin has the function of importing the secret
key and certificate of the developer account into the temporary key
chain, but as the constraint of macOS can not handle different key chain
for each session, the job handling the key chain If you execute them in
parallel, this will not work properly.

As one of workarounds, it is impossible to limit the maximum number of
jobs around Jenkins' node to 1 and to execute multiple nodes with
different macOS accounts.  

###### Setting up a build step

Add the XCode build step to a free-style project and set the target
(e.g. `MyApp`), configuration (e.g. `Release`) and check the build IPA
and update version number options. This will give you a single,
versioned .ipa file. You can also select to clean the project before a
build; while this will make sure that the project is starting from a
clean state, it will make large projects take a lot longer.

###### Setting up a unit test step

Add the XCode build step and this time specify your unit test target
(e.g. `MyAppTests`), configuration (e.g. `Debug`) and the SDK (e.g.
`Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator4.1.sdk/`).  
Leave all the checkboxes unselected. The SDK needs to be supplied here
as the unit tests will only be run when building under the simulator's
SDK.  
Check the "Publish JUnit test result report" option in the project
config and set the value `"*``/test-reports/``*.xml"` under "Test report
XMLs". This will tell Jenkins to pick up the JUnit-format test reports.

Otherwise Release build will usually fail because it won't be able to find application symbols to link with test bundle. Arguments are currently separated by space, enclosing them in quotes won't help.|
|Copy provisioning profile  	|copyProvisioningProfile	|2.0.7      	|If Checked, and the filename of provisioning profile is specified in "Provisioning profile UUID", the specified file is copied to a predetermined place.

###### Setting up a Export IPA step

If you add the Export IPA step and set up the information necessary for
exporting the IPA file, the location of the archive, the export method,
code signature information, etc., you can export the IPA from the
archive output in the Xcode Build step.

###### Export IPA configuration parameters

#### Compiling Xcode projects and exporting IPApackages using Jenkins's Pipeline function
    
1.  Import developer profile.

    ``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
            importDeveloperProfile(importIntoExistingKeychain: false,
                profileId: 'XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX')
    ```

2.  Build the project and output the archive.

    ``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
            xcodeBuild(
              xcodeSchema: "${PROJECT_SCHEMA}",
              ipaOutputDirectory: 'Release',
              ipaExportMethod: 'app-store',
              generateArchive: true,
              buildIpa: true,
              ipaName: "${BUILD_TARGET}",
              bundleID: 'com.example.TargetApp',
              developmentTeamName: "${DEVELOPMENT_TEAM_NAME}",
              cleanBeforeBuild: true,
              configuration: 'Release',
              cfBundleShortVersionStringValue: '1.0.0',
              cfBundleVersionValue: '1'
            )
    ```

3.  Export the IPA file from the archive.

    ``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
        exportIpa(
            archiveDir: "${WORKSPACE}/${repositoryName}/build/Release-iphoneos",
            xcodeSchema: "${PROJECT_SCHEMA}",
            developmentTeamName: "${DEVELOPMENT_TEAM}",
            configuration: "AdHoc",
            infoPlistPath: "${INFO_PLIST}",
            manualSigning: true,
            provisioningProfiles: [
                [provisioningProfileAppId: "${BUNDLE_ID}", provisioningProfileUUID: 'TestApp_AdHoc_Profile.mobileprovision']
                [provisioningProfileAppId: "${BUNDLE_ID}.watchkitapp", provisioningProfileUUID: 'TestApp_AdHoc_Profile.mobileprovision'],
                [provisioningProfileAppId: "${BUNDLE_ID}.watchkitapp.watchkitextension", provisioningProfileUUID: 'TestApp_AdHoc_Profile.mobileprovision']
            ],
            ipaExportMethod: "ad-hoc",
            ipaName: "${BUILD_TARGET}",
            ipaOutputDirectory: "AdHoc"
        )
    ```

4.  Upload the exported IPA file.  

> When using "XCode's" Automatically manage signing ", various ways are required, so please note the points to be noted separately.

#####  Using multiple versions of xcode.

One can easily support multiple versions by using environment variables.
But first one need to install multiple versions on the build server.
Here's one strategy:

###### install multiple versions of xcode

0\. Note current config.

xcode-select -p

1\. download xcode DMGs from <http://developer.apple.com/downloads/>

2\. enable install from everywhere (under System preferences / Security)

Without that I had problems installing xcode, without graphical
feedback, tested on 10.9.5, freshly booted.

Symptoms were:

-   app not responsive
-   Getting errors like in /var/log/system.log

Someone attempted to start application App:"Xcode" asn:0x0-1b62b61
pid:57656 refs=6 @ 0x7fa5d9f6df40 but it still has
\_kLSApplicationLockedInStoppedStateKey=true, so it is is staying
stopped. : LASApplication.cp \#2468 SetApplicationInStoppedState()
q=LSSession 100027/0x186bb queue

3\. open DMG file, copy app to /Applications. This might take a while.

4\. close /Volumes/Xcode (otherwise installation won't start)

5\. start Xcode, accept agreement, install missing packages if necessary.
This might take a while. Close xcode after GUI opens.

6\. move freshly installed Xcode to new path, e.g.

sudo mv /Applications/Xcode.app /Applications/Xcode6.1.app

(I use this so that the xcode app appears with version number under
spotlight)

7\. reset default xcode-select if necessary (installation might have
changed it / reset to /Applications/Xcode.app)

sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode6.1.app

(Note the part above could be fully automated....)

###### Select the xcode version at runtime

1\. Use EnvInject plugin  
2. for jobs that require the non default do something like

DEVELOPER\_DIR=/Applications/Xcode6.0.1.app/Contents/Developer

under Inject environment variables to the build process

###### Select the xcode version at runtime (Version 2.0.3 or later)

1. Register the distinguished name and location of the installed Xcode
using ’Global Tool Configuration’.  
2. Select Xcode registered in 'Global Tool Configuration' in Job's
'Xcode Tools Version'.

That's it.

#### FAQ

##### User interaction is not allowed

When code-signing, a prompt may appear on the build machine asking
whether to allow keychain access.  
This will block the build with a message like
`"User interaction is not allowed"` until it is dismissed.  
Just select 'Always Allow' the first time and it shouldn't need to ask
again.  
![](docs/images/308d472628999c9f1961068c9af34e49a31c76c7.png)

If this prompt is not showing on the build machine, you can force it to
appear by running the codesign command that failed from a terminal on
the build machine:   /usr/bin/codesign --force --sign "iPhone
Distribution: .....

##### No Xcode folder is set

\[sources\] $ /usr/bin/xcodebuild -version xcode-select: Error: No Xcode
folder is set. Run xcode-select -switch \<xcode\_folder\_path\> to set
the path to the Xcode folder. Error: /usr/bin/xcode-select returned
unexpected error. FATAL: Check your XCode installation. Jenkins cannot
retrieve its version.

You probably just installed XCode (by default it is in `/Developer`) but
its path isn't configured. You can fix it with

xcode-select -switch /Developer/

You should now be able to execute `xcodebuild`. Ex :

host:\~ user$ /usr/bin/xcodebuild -version Xcode 4.2 Build version 4C199

##### Xcode 4.3

XCode 4.3 changes [2
things](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/Articles/xcode_4_3.html)
that are important for our usage on a slave or a master :

-   **Command-Line Tools Are Optional** : The command-line tools are not
    bundled with Xcode 4.3 by default. Instead, they have to be
    installed using the Components tab of the Downloads preferences
    panel
    ![](docs/images/8f2803dc1d2d272296cfa2ba044a3286e29a374c.jpg)
-   **/Developer No Longer Exists** : You may have to reconfigure its
    path like this:

    sudo xcode-select -switch
    /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/
