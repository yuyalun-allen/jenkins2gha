# Contrast Jenkins Plugin

Repository for the Contrast Jenkins plugin. This plugin adds the ability to configure a connection to a Jenkins Build.

## Requirements
* Jenkins version >= 2.60.3
> Note: for Jenkins versions between 1.625.3 and 2.60.3, use plugin version [2.12.1](https://github.com/jenkinsci/contrast-continuous-application-security-plugin/releases/tag/contrast-continuous-application-security-2.12.1)

## Documentation
[Contrast Docs](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/jenkins.html)

## Charts

There are 2 charts that are generated after each build `Vulnerability Trends Across Builds` and `Severity Trends Across Builds`.

Here are two examples of the charts:
