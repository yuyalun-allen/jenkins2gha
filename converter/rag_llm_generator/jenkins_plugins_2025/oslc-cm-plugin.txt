This plugin is an OSLC-CM consumer. On the occurence of a build
failure, it allows automated creation of bug reports in bug trackers
having OSLC support, using Oauth and REST.

It also allows some user interaction mode to create bugs using an
OSLC-CM provider's delegated creation dialog.

For more details of the OSLC (Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration) 
protocol, see  http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/CmHome
