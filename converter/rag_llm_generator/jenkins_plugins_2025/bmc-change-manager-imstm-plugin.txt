## Requirements <a name="req"></a>
| Required software                 | Version |
|-----------------------------------|---------|
| Jenkins                           | 2.346.2   |

| z/OSMF                            |    |

## Overview <a name="overview"></a>
BMC AMI DevOps for Change Manager for IMS TM plugin can be invoked as a Jenkins job's **build step**. It allows assimilation of BMC AMI Change Manager for IMS TM capabilities in Dev/Ops processes. It takes advantage of BMC AMI Change Manager for IMS TM functionality to dynamically activate changes to IMS objects.

It provides the following capabilities:
- Creating and Editing DELTA Lists.
- Checking a DELTA List against the IMS control region without implementing the changes. The Check function
verifies the elements you have inserted or changed on the DELTA List.
- Executing a DELTA List implements the DELTA List on the IMS control region and logs all of the changes it makes.

The plugin uses z/OSMF REST API to submit the following jobs to run on z/OS.
- DLPBTSCT - Utility that is used to check or execute DELTA List in batch. BMCXLINK task is not required.
- DLPYLIST - Sample user exit to create DELTA List records in batch using control cards.

**Notes!**

- Notice that the values for the different keywords are not explicitly displayed in the generated JCL.
  Instead placeholders (which are marked with ${}) are used.
  The placeholders are being internally resolved into variables by Jenkins during the build process.
  Therefore, it’s not recommended to modify the JCL, but it’s possible.

- **Script Security Plugin** is used, thus an administrator will have to approve the scripts.
  Otherwise a security exception is thrown:
  ERROR: Failed to evaluate groovy script.
  org.jenkinsci.plugins.scriptsecurity.scripts.UnapprovedUsageException: script not yet approved for use

  An administrator will have to approve via Manage Jenkins -> In-process Script Approval

## Authenticating the SSL Certificate <a name="cert"></a>
1. Distribute the z/OS certificate to the appropriate workstation, and import it into Java KeyStore using keytool.
2. Issue the following command from the command line:
```
keytool -import -alias <alias_name> -keystore <keystore_name > -file <file_name>
```
where:
- **alias_name** - alias name of the entry to process
- **keystore_name** - the location of the cacerts file , By default it is in jre/lib/security/cacerts
- **file_name**- file.cer
  You will be asked for password (which is by default : changeit). Enter the password.
  Restart your Java Virtual Machine or your computer.
