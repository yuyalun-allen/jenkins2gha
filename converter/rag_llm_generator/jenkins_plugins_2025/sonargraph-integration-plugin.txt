# Sonargraph Integration Plugin

This plugin integrates
[Sonargraph](https://www.hello2morrow.com/products/sonargraph) version 9
and newer into your build. Sonargraph allows to define an architecture
for a software system and automatically checks how the code base
conforms to it.

#### Contents

## Introduction

[Sonargraph](https://www.hello2morrow.com/products/sonargraph) analyzes
the static (i.e. compile-time) dependencies of your software. The
free-of-charge license for the integration with Jenkins and also
[SonarQube](http://www.sonarsource.org/) allows to detect cyclic
dependencies and additional metrics. You can mark the build as
"unstable" or "failed" if cyclic dependencies are detected.  
The real benefit of Sonargraph is that you can define a logical
architecture and perform automatic checks how the code conforms to it.
This functionality is only available for free, if you are working on a
non-commercial Open-Source project. More information is available on our
[homepage](https://www.hello2morrow.com/), you can check there if you
are eligible for a [free
license](https://www.hello2morrow.com/products/pricelist).

The Sonargraph Build component integrates Sonargraph in Ant, Bazel, Gradle,
Maven and Shell based builds. The [online
manual](http://eclipse.hello2morrow.com/doc/build/content/index.html)
provides more details. This Jenkins plugin allows to define if the build
should be marked as "unstable" or "failed" if architecture violations,
cyclic dependencies, etc. are detected. Trends of metrics are displayed
in charts and additionally the generated detailed HTML report is
available for each build.

## Getting Started

If you already have Sonargraph integrated in your build, and a
Sonargraph report is already generated during one of your build steps,
use the post-build step called "Sonargraph Integration Report Generation
& Analysis", and select "Pre-generated". In this case no global Jenkins
configuration for Sonargraph Build is needed.

If you are new to Sonargraph, we advice you to register on our
[Sonargraph Web Site](http://www.hello2morrow.com/), have a look at the
whitepapers and screencasts to get an idea of Sonargraph's
capabilities.  
You need to have a license in order to analyse a project. To get started
an evaluation license or the free integration license is sufficient.

If you are new to Sonargraph, use the post-build step called "Sonargraph
Integration Report Generation & Analysis", and select "Generate with
Sonargraph Build". In this case an installation of SonargraphBuild must
be configured in global Jenkins configuration.

**NOTE:** This Jenkins plugin requires Sonargraph version 9 and newer.
For Sonargraph version 7 use [Sonargraph
Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Sonargraph+Plugin).

## Global Configuration

The first step is to configure one or more versions of Sonargraph Build in "Manage Jenkins"-> "Global Tool Configuration"

### Tool Installation for Sonargraph Build

**NOTE:** This global configuration is only required when you are going
to use the "Generate with Sonargraph Build" option in "Sonargraph
Integration Generation & Analysis" post-build action.

To see the global configuration options after installing the plugin, go
to "Manage Jenkins" -> "Global Tool Configuration". You will find the "Sonargraph Build" section

<img src="screenshot/GlobalToolConfiguration1.png"/>

Press button "Sonargraph Build Installations..." to see the list of
already installed Sonargraph Build installations Jenkins knows about, if
any. To add a new "Installation" of Sonargraph Build press button "Add
Sonargraph Build", give it a descriptive name, use default Installer
"Install from hello2morrow" for it, and select a Sonargraph Build
version from the version drop down box.

<img src="screenshot/GlobalToolConfiguration2.png"/>

**NOTE:** Version "newest" automatically updates your Sonargraph Build
installation to the most recent version.

### Sonargraph License Server

Sonargraph uses a web-based hello2morrow license server for activation
code based licenses by default.  
If you run your own local Sonargraph license server configure it at "Manage Jenkins" -\> "Configure System".

<img src="screenshot/LicenseServerConfiguration.png"/>

## Job Configuration

Use the post-build action "Sonargraph Integration Report Generation &
Analysis" to create Sonargraph's XML and HTML reports (or use a
pre-generated XML report) and to configure how the Sonargraph analysis
should affect the final result of the build.  
For every Sonargraph metric supported by this plugin, you have the
following options:

-   Don't mark: Will not change the build result in any way.
-   Build unstable: If the value for this metric is greater than zero,
    the build result will be set as "unstable".
-   Build failed: If the value for this metric is greater than zero, the
    build result will be set as "failure".

Take into account that if you have set to mark the build unstable for
one metric, failed for any other and both metric's value are greater
than zero, the worst state will prevail, so the build will be marked as
failure in this case.  
Besides controlling the build result, the plugin also generates graphics
to monitor the trend of metrics across builds and it will display the
full Sonargraph HTML report for each build.

NOTE: For the free Jenkins / SonarQube license, only the options for
"cyclic elements" and "empty workspace" are available.

### Add post-build action

Add post build action "Sonargraph Integration Report Generation & Analysis" to your job.

<img src="screenshot/AddPostBuildAction.png"/>

## Use Pre-Generated Report

Use this option to use a pre-generated Sonargraph report. To do so you
must use Sonargraph Maven plugin, Sonargraph Gradle plugin, or
Sonargraph Ant task in another upstream build step.  
Enter the path to the Sonargraph XML report file that has been generated
via the ANT task of Sonargraph. This path must be relative to the
workspace.

<img src="screenshot/PreGeneratedReport.png"/>

-   **"Sonargraph XML Report"** Enter the path to the pre-generated
    Sonargraph XML report file (without extension ".xml"). This path
    must be relative to the workspace.

## Generate Report with Sonargraph Build

Use this option to let Sonargraph Build create a Sonargraph report.

<img src="screenshot/GenerateWithSonargraphBuild.png"/>

-   **"Sonargraph System Directory"** Enter the path to the Sonargraph
    system (\*.sonargraph) directory. This path must be relative to the
    workspace.
-   **"Sonargraph License File"** Sonargraph license file location. If
    this parameter is not specified, you must specify the activation
    code parameter.
-   **"Sonargraph Activation Code"** Sonargraph license activation code.
    If this parameter is not specified, you must specify a license file
    parameter.

<img src="screenshot/AdvancedOptions.png"/>

-   **"Skip"** Skip Sonargraph Jenkins Plugin.
-   **"UseProxy"** Use Jenkins proxy configuration when
    connecting to Sonargraph license server.
-   **"Workspace Profile"** The profile file name (e.g.
    "BuildProfile.xml") for transforming the workspace paths to match
    the build environment.
-   **"Quality Model File"** Use a built-in Quality Model, or an
    external Quality Model instead of the Quality Model included in
    Sonargraph Software System. Must be either a file within workspace
    with extension "sgqm", or one of the built-in Quality Models
    -   Sonargraph:Default.sgqm (language-independent)
    -   Sonargraph:Java.sgqm (language-specific)
    -   Sonargraph:CSharp.sgqm (language-specific)
    -   Sonargraph:CPlusPlus.sgqm (language-specific)
-   **"Virtual Model"** The virtual model to be used when checking for
    issues. This parameter overrides the default virtual model that is
    set when the system is opened. Licensing:
    -   Sonargraph Explorer Changing virtual models is not supported,
        "Parser" model is taken.
    -   Sonargraph Architect Changing virtual models is supported,
        "Modifiable.vm" is taken by default.
-   **"Snapshot Directory"** Target directory for the created snapshot.
    Only if either this parameter or snapshotFileName is provided, a
    snapshot will be generated. Parameter can only be used with
    Sonargraph Architect license.
-   **"Snapshot File Name"** The target file name (without extension).
    Only if either this parameter or snapshotDirectory is provided, a
    snapshot will be generated. Parameter can only be used with
    Sonargraph Architect license.
-   **"Sonargraph Build Version"** Select the Sonargraph Build version.
-   **"JDK"** Select a JDK to be used for Sonargraph Build.
-   **"Java"** Select if your Sonargraph system uses Java.
-   **"C\#"** Select if your Sonargraph system uses C\#.
-   **"C++"** Select if your Sonargraph system uses C+.
-   **"Python"** Select if your Sonargraph system uses Python.

<img src="screenshot/Logging.png"/>

-   **"Log level"** Level of logging detail. One of: off, error, warn,
    info, debug, trace, all. Default: info.
-   **"Log file"** Path of the log file to be used for SonargraphBuild
    (relative to workspace of Jenkins job). Default:
    sonargraph\_build.log.

<img src="screenshot/Baseline.png"/>

-   **"Baseline Report Path"** Path to the baseline Sonargraph XML report 
    file (without extension ".xml"). This path must be relative to the workspace.

### Chart Configuration

Besides controlling the build result, the plugin also generates graphics
to monitor the trend of metrics across builds and it will display the
full Sonargraph HTML report for each build.

<img src="screenshot/ChartConfiguration.png" alt="Chart Configuration"/>

Either select the charts that you want to show by their language, or
show all of them by selecting "All charts".

<img src="screenshot/SelectCharts.png" alt="Select Charts"/>

### Mark Build

For every Sonargraph metric supported by this plugin, you have the
following options:

-   **Don't mark:** Will not change the build result in any way.
-   **Build unstable:** If the value for this metric is greater than zero,
    the build result will be set as "unstable".
-   **Build failed:** If the value for this metric is greater than zero, the
    build result will be set as "failure".

Take into account that if you have set to mark the build unstable for
one metric, failed for any other and both metric's value are greater
than zero, the worst state will prevail, so the build will be marked as
failure in this case.

NOTE: For the free Jenkins / SonarQube license, only the options for
"cyclic elements" and "empty workspace" are available.

## Configure Jenkins Logging

Sonargraph's Jenkins integration uses the standard Jenkins logger
mechanism to provide feedback to the user about the events that occur
during the execution of the post-build action or the generation of the
graphics. To enable this feature follow these steps:

-   Go to "Manage Jenkins" -> "System Log".
-   Click "Add new log recorder" button.
-   Provide the name you wish for this log recorder.
-   In the field logger, provide the value with the exact value
    "com.hello2morrow.sonargraph.integration.jenkins" (Without the
    quotation marks).
-   Select the logging level for this logger.

Now you should have the new log recorder configured like this:

<img src="screenshot/SonargraphLogger.png"/>

-   Click the save button.

When first created this log recorder is going to be empty and you will
be able to see messages as the post-build actions are executed and
graphics are generated.
