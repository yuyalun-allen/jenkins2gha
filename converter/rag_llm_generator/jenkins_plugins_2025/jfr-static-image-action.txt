## Example

`jfr-static-image-action` is a classical docker action so the running container cannot be shared with other actions.
Therefore, the users cannot use other GitHub Actions except using `actions/checkout` to set up the workspace. 
The users can call this action by using `jenkinsci/jfr-static-image-action@master`.
```yaml
name: CI
on: [push]
jobs:
  jfr-static-image-action-pipeline:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Jenkins pipeline in the container
        uses:
          jenkinsci/jfr-static-image-action@master
        with:
          command: run
          jenkinsfile: Jenkinsfile
          pluginstxt: plugins.txt
          jcasc: jcasc.yml 
```
