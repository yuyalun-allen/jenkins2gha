Google Git Notes Plugin
====================

This plugin provides automatic recording of Jenkins build actions to Git Notes.

Usage
===
Requires the use of the Git Plugin. Go to the Configure page for any build that uses a Git SCM, and check the 'Log Build Status to Git Notes' box under Build Environment. This will trigger writes to Git Notes when the build starts and stops. Data is written in JSON format and includes the build URL and, if available, build result (success/failure).
