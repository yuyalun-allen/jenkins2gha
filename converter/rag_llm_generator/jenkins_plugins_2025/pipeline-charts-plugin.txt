# Pipeline Charting Plugin

This Jenkins plugin enables flexible charting capabilities for pipelines.

## Compatibility Notice

This plugin is still in early development. While functional, design decisions may still need to be revisited, breaking data recorded in earlier versions. This will be indicated by a compatibility warning in plugin manager.

## Usage

This plugin provides the `addChartData` step. it has the following mandatory arguments:

* `y`: The numeric value to use for the Y axis coordinates of the point to add.

The following arguments are optional:

* `chart`: Which chart to record this value for. Default value is `default`.
* `series`: Which series (inside a chart) to record this value for. Default value is `default`.
* `x`: The label for the X axis. Defaults to the build number. Must be unique per 

In one build, any number of points can be added to any number of charts and series, but only one point per chart, series, and x coordinate will be shown.

/* TODO: Which one? */

## Example

The following pipeline, executed a few time, can result in the output below:

	addChartData chart: "Random 1", y: Math.random() * 500, series: "500 max"
	addChartData chart: "Random 1", y: Math.random() * 200, series: "200 max"

	addChartData y: Math.random() * 5
