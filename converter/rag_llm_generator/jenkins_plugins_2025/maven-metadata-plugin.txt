# Maven Metadata Plugin

## Project Status

This project is looking for maintainers. Our current work and responsibilities don't include this plugin and we not able to properly
maintain it anymore. If you want to adopt this plugin see https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/plugin-governance/adopt-a-plugin/

## About

This plugin adds a new build parameter _List maven artifact versions_. If you select this type and enter a `repositoryURL`,
`groupId` and `artifactId` the plugin will check for that artifact at the given repository and let whoever started the
build select a version of the artifact to bind as a build parameter.

There are also several options to provide default values which will also be evaluated at run-time:
- `FIRST` - will evaluate to the first item in the drop-down that would have been presented had the build been executed manually
- `LAST` - will evaluate to the last item in the drop-down that would have been presented had the build been executed manually.
- `RELEASE` - will evaluate to the version marked as `release` in the _maven-metadata.xml_ for the configured artifact.
  The versionFilter even if defined is ignored for this default value.
- `LATEST` - will evaluate to the version marked as `latest` in the _maven-metadata.xml_  for the configured artifact.
  The versionFilter even if defined is ignored for this default value.

This plugin does not download anything but rather sets build environment variables describing the artifact and
where it can be downloaded from.

For example: In your configuration you have created a parameter named `MY_JAR` and have configured all values correctly.
Then the following parameters will be set for the build step:

- `MY_JAR_VERSION` - the version you selected in the dropdown or that was selected as part of an automated build
- `MY_JAR_ARTIFACT_URL` - the full URL to the actual artifact selected. You can use something like `wget` to download that artifact and do something with it.
- `MY_JAR_GROUP_ID` - echoes back your configuration
- `MY_JAR_ARTIFACT_ID` - echoes back your configuration
- `MY_JAR_CLASSIFIER` - echoes back your configuration
- `MY_JAR_PACKAGING` - echoes back your configuration

If all you need to do is download an artifact from a repository and use it during your build you can consider using the
[Repository Connector Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Repository+Connector+Plugin) plugin instead.

## Development

### Requirements

Built and tested against Jenkins 2.32.1.

### Development workspace

When starting the development Jenkins using `mvn hpi:run` and the _work_ directory containing the `JENKINS_HOME` doesn't
already exist, the workspace will be created with some pre-configured test jobs for the plugin. The re-creation of the
development workspace can be forced by deleting the _work_ directory before running `mvn hpi:run` - of course, all manual
changes, as well as build histories will be lost then.

If You're developing behind a proxy and/or a [Maven Repository Manager](https://maven.apache.org/repository-management.html),
it may be useful to change the `repoBaseUrl` to the base URL of Your organisations repository manager. This can easily
be achieved by setting the system property `dev.repoBaseUrl` when starting the development Jenkins for the first time
(after the _work_ directory was deleted). You may just set the system property in Your `MAVEN_OPTS`...
