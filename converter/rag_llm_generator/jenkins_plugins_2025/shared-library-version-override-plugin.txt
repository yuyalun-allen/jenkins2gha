## Overview

With this plugin, you can configure a specific version of a [Shared Library](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/) in folders.

## Setup

- Be sure you have [Pipeline Groovy Libraries](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-groovy-lib/) installed
- Go to the configuration page of your Folder, Organization Folder, Pipeline Multibranches, ...
- Under The *Shared Library Version Override* section, add a new *Custom Configuration* element

## Security

- A *Global Pipeline Library* without the "Allow default version to be overridden" option, can't be overridden with this plugin, a custom configuration will be skipped.
- An overridden *Global Trusted Pipeline Library* will still be trusted.  
- An overridden *Global Untrusted Pipeline Library* or a *Pipeline Library* defined at Folder level, will still be untrusted so their code runs with sandbox restrictions and cannot use @Grab.
