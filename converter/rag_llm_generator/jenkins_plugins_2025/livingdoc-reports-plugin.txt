LivingDoc is a powerful tool that supports implementing collaboration driven methods like Behavior Driven Development or Specification By Example. Due to its smart integration into Atlassian Confluence the comfortable editing possibilities of confluences can be used to write the feature specifications and the acceptance tests.

The jenkins reports plugin parses the execution results of LivingDoc, prepares them to be displayed in jenkins and when needed it publishes them to Confluence
