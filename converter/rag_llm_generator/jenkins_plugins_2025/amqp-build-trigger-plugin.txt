# AMQP Build Trigger for Jenkins
This Jenkins plugin will trigger builds when AMQP messages are received from AMQP message sources (typically a broker with a queue or topic). Each job may specify one or more AMQP sources from which to recieve messages. If any AMQP message is received from any of the configured sources, then a build is triggered. The same source may also be used to trigger multiple jobs.

Note that the message content plays no role in message triggering. The only criterion for triggering a job is that a message is received from the specified AMQP source.

## Basic Configuration
Within each job, scroll down to the **Build Triggers** section (or click on the **Build Triggers** tab) and then locate the **[AmqpBuildTrigger]** checkbox. Select the **[AmqpBuildTrigger]** checkbox to enable the trigger.

Each job may specify multiple AMQP sources for trigger messages. Initially, the list will be empty. Click the **Add** button to add an AMQP trigger source.

This will create a new empty server parameters block. To complete this block:

* Enter the **URL** in the format `amqp://ip-addr[:port]`, eg `amqp://localhost` or `amqp://localhost:5672` or `amqp://10.0.0.5:35672`
* If necessary, enter a **User** and **Password** for logging onto the server. If supplied, the connection will use SASL `PLAIN` authentication, otherwise if left blank, `ANONYMOUS`. Make sure the server is configured for this type of access and that the user (if set) is known to it.
* Enter a **Source address** from which to receive messages. If the server is a broker, then this is usually the name of a *queue* or *topic*.

* A **Test Source** button if clicked will establish a temporary connection to the server and report `Ok` if it worked, otherwise an error message will be displayed.

To add additional sources, click the **Add** button. To remove a source, click the red **X** button at the top of each block.

Finally, click the **Save** button at the bottom of the form to save the settings. Once these settings are saved, a new connection to each server will be established and a listener will wait for messages.

**NOTE:** If you have the `qpid-cpp-client-devel` package installed, it is possible to test a configuration by quickly sending a trigger message using `qpid-send` through a broker as follows (and to which the trigger must be configured to listen):
```
qpid-send [-b <broker-url>] -a <queue-name> -m1
```
where `<broker-url>` is the broker URL (defaults to `localhost` if not provided), and `<queue-name>` is replaced by the queue name configured in the **Source Address** field for your project. To get help, use `qpid-send -h` or `qpid-send --help`.
