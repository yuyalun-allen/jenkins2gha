# Fortify Jenkins plugin

This is the official Jenkins plugin for Fortify Static Code Analyzer (SCA) and Fortify Software Security Center (SSC).

| Plugin Information                                                                          |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

The plugin adds the ability to perform security analysis with Fortify Static Code Analyzer, upload results to Fortify Software Security Center, show analysis results summary, and set build failure criteria based on analysis results.

### Summary

Use the Fortify Jenkins Plugin in your continuous integration builds to identify security issues in your source code using Fortify Static Code Analyzer. After the Fortify Static Code Analyzer analysis is complete, you can upload the results to a Fortify Software Security Center server. The Fortify Jenkins Plugin also enables you to view the analysis result details within Jenkins. It provides metrics for each build and an overview of the results, without requiring you to log into Fortify Software Security Center.

### Documentation

You can find official plugin documentation here: https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/fortify-jenkins-plugin/

### Features

*   Provides a post-build action to analyze the source with Fortify Static Code Analyzer, update Security Content, analyze remotely with Fortify ScanCentral SAST, upload analysis results to Fortify Software Security Center, and set the build status to unstable depending on uploaded results processed by Fortify Software Security Center
*   Provides pipeline support for source code analysis locally with Fortify Static Code Analyzer and remotely with Fortify ScanCentral SAST, updating Security Content, and uploading analysis results to Fortify Software Security Center
*   Displays analysis results for each Job analyzed locally with Fortify Static Code Analyzer, which includes a history trend and the latest issues from Fortify Software Security Center, and navigation to individual issues on Fortify Software Security Center for detailed analysis

### Setup

This set of instructions describes how to configure the plugin to run a local Fortify Static Code Analyzer scan, upload the analysis results to Software Security Center, and then see the analysis results in Jenkins. You can also run the analysis with ScanCentral SAST. See the full documentation for instructions.

1.  Create an authentication token of type CIToken. 
        Log in to Fortify Software Security Center, click the **Administration** tab and select **Users \> Token Management** on the left pane.
        Click **New** to create an authentication token of type CIToken, and then click **Save**.
        Copy the decoded token at the bottom of the dialog box.

2.  In Jenkins, install the Fortify plugin.

3.  From the Jenkins menu, select **Jenkins \> Manage Jenkins \> Configure System**. To trigger an unstable build based on the results and to see analysis results in Jenkins, you need to upload the locally run analysis results to Fortify Software Security Center. Scroll down to the **Fortify Assessment** section, and then do the following:
    -   In the **SSC URL** box, type the Fortify Software Security Center server URL. 
    -   Below the **Authentication token** box, click **Add \> Jenkins** to open the Jenkins Credentials Provider dialog box and add a credential of the type **Fortify Connection Token**. Add a description for the credential, and paste the token value you created in step 1 in the **Token** box.
    -   To use the proxy settings configured in Jenkins for connecting to Fortify Software Security Center, select **Use Jenkins proxy**. 
    -   Click **Test SSC connection**.

4.  To analyze your project with Fortify Static Code Analyzer or to update Fortify security content as part of your build, make sure that the Fortify Static Code Analyzer is in the system Path environment variable or create a Jenkins environment variable to specify the location of the Fortify Static Code Analyzer executable. In **Global properties**, create the following environment variable:
    -   **Name:** FORTIFY\_HOME
    -   **Value:** *\<sca\_install\_dir\>*
where *\<sca\_install\_dir\>* is the path where Fortify Static Code Analyzer is installed. For example, on Windows the default installation location is C:\\Program
Files\\Fortify\\Fortify\_SCA\_and\_Apps\_*\<version\>*.

### Configuration when running Jenkins from Docker

When running Jenkins in a Docker container, mount *\<sca\_install\_dir\>* directory to the Docker container to make Fortify Static Code Analyzer executables
accessible from Docker. The following command is an example of how to do this:

    docker container run \
      -p 8080:8080 \
      -v /home/admin/Fortify/Fortify_SCA_and_Apps_22.1.0:/var/jenkins_home/Fortify/Fortify_SCA_and_Apps_22.1.0 \
      --name=jenkins \
      jenkins/jenkins -d

For this example, the value of FORTIFY\_HOME is `/var/Jenkins_home/Fortify/Fortify_SCA_and_Apps_22.1.0`.
