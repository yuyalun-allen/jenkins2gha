##### [via the interface][jenkins_install_interface]
1. Go to your installation's management screen.
2. Click **Manage Plugins**.
3. Click the **Available** tab.
4. Find the **CrossBrowserTesting.com Plugin** and select the checkbox.
5. then click either **Install without restart** or **Download now and install after restart**.

##### [by hand][jenkins_install_byhand] (*not recommended*)
1. Download [CrossBrowserTesting.hpi][latest_version].
2. Save the downloaded .hpi file into your `$JENKINS_HOME/plugins` directory.
3. Restart Jenkins.

### Building the plugin for testing/development

##### Requirements:
- [JDK][java] &#8805; 8

<pre>gradlew server</pre>
###### To specify the version of jenkins:
<pre>gradlew server -Pjenkins=${jenkins_version}</pre>

###### To make it run a little faster, turn on caching:
<pre>gradlew server -Pjenkins=${jenkins_version} -Dstapler.jelly.noCache=false</pre>

##### To build test plugin
After you have made all changes, update the version number in `build.gradle` (line 10). Run `./gradlew build`, then `./gradlew compileJava`. This will create a 'build' folder in the root the project. Inside that folder is a 'libs' folder that contains a .hpi file. Remove any existing version of the CBT Plugin from your Jenkins server, then place that .hpi file into your Jenkins plugin folder, restart Jenkins, and test.

##### To release:
Make sure all code has been committed and pushed up to GitHub.
<pre>gradlew publish release</pre>
Credentials for the publish should be in a file [~/.jenkins-ci.org][jenkins_credentials_documentation] (note that this goes in your home directory)

If you get a 403 error on this step, it may be because the version in `build.gradle` is wrong or hasn't been updated. You can check by going to [our plugin releases folder in Jenkins](https://repo.jenkins-ci.org/releases/org/jenkins-ci/plugins/crossbrowsertesting/). If the folder for the version you are trying to push already exists, then you'll get a 403 on the publish.
