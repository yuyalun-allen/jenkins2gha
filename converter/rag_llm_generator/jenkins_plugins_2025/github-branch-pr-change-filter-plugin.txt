## Introduction

When using a GitHub branch source, this trait allows you to filter discovered pull requests by including only those that match a provided regex.

## Getting started

Add a discovery trait a provide a valid regex to match against full file names. If any files in a PR matched the provided regex, the discovered pull request will be included. You may also provide regex to exclude files that would otherwise be matched by the inclusion regex.  
*Note: Regex matches are currently case-insensitive*
