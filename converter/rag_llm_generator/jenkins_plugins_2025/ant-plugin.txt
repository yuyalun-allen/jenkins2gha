# Description

This plugin adds [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) support to Jenkins

This functionality used to be a part of the core, but as of Jenkins 1.431, it was split off into a separate plugin.

# Installation and usage

## Installation

For this plugin to be used, an Ant installation must be specified in the
global Jenkins configuration. It can be installed automatically:

Or manually:

## Usage

![](docs/images/usage.png)

-   **Ant Version:** Ant Installation to use. See previous section.
-   **Targets:** Ant targets to invoke. If left blank, default target will be invoked.
-   **Build File:** Build file to use. If left blank, plugin will look for `build.xml` in the root directory.
-   **Properties:** Additional parameters (typical properties file format) to pass to the build. They are passed like `-Dname=value`
-   **Java Options:** Custom `ANT_OPTS`.


An example of using the Ant task inside Pipeline DSL.
This code snippet must be put inside a `script` block when using the declarative syntax.

```groovy
withAnt(installation: 'myinstall') {
    dir("scoring") {
    if (isUnix()) {
      sh "ant mytarget"
    } else {
      bat "ant mytarget"
    }
}
```
