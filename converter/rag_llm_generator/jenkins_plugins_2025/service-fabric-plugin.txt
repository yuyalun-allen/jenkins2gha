To manually install the plugin:

1. Clone the repo and build:
   ```
   mvn package
   ```
2. Open your Jenkins dashboard, go to Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins.
3. Go to Advanced tab, under Upload Plugin section, click Choose File.
4. Select `service-fabric.hpi` in `target` folder of your repo, click Upload.
5. Restart your Jenkins instance after installation is completed.

## Usage

You can have a look at our [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cicd-your-linux-applications-with-jenkins) to understand more about building and deploying Linux Service Fabric applications using Jenkins.

## Pipeline

You can call the function `azureServiceFabricPublish` from your Jenkins Pipeline to deploy your application to
Service Fabric. You can also use the the Jenkins ***Pipeline Syntax*** to generate the Pipeline snippet from
the form UI.

* Deploy with Azure resource configuration:

   ```groovy
   azureServiceFabricPublish azureCredentialsId: 'Jenkins-credentials-ID-for-Azure-service-principal',
                             resourceGroup: 'resource-group-containing-the-service-fabric-cluster',
                             serviceFabric: 'service-fabric-name',
                             clientCert: 'Certificate-File-Path',
                             clientKey: 'Key-File-Path',
                             applicationName: 'fabric:/Your-Application-Name',
                             applicationType: 'Your-Application-Type',
                             manifestPath: 'Relative/path/to/ApplicationManifest.xml'
   ```

* Deploy with direct Service Fabric endpoint:

   ```groovy
   azureServiceFabricPublish managementHost: 'management.host.name.of.your.cluster',
                             clientCert: 'Certificate-File-Path',
                             clientKey: 'Key-File-Path',
                             applicationName: 'fabric:/Your-Application-Name',
                             applicationType: 'Your-Application-Type',
                             manifestPath: 'Relative/path/to/ApplicationManifest.xml'
   ```
