Jenkins Deploy Plugin
=========================

This plugin permits Jenkins to Deploy into containers and application servers. It takes a war/ear file and deploys that to a running remote application server at the end of a build. The implementation is based on [Cargo](https://codehaus-cargo.github.io/cargo/Home.html). The list of currently supported containers include:

-   Tomcat 4.x/5.x/6.x/7.x/8.x/9.x
-   JBoss 3.x/4.x/5.x/6.x/7.x
-   Glassfish 2.x/3.x/4.x

Refer to the [Deploy WebSphere
Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/websphere-deployer/)
to deploy to a running remote WebSphere Application Server.  
Refer to the [WebLogic Deployer
Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/weblogic-deployer-plugin/)
to deploy to a running remote WebLogic Application Server.

#### How to rollback or redeploy a previous build

There may be several ways to accomplish this, but here is one suggested
method:

1.  Install the [Copy Artifact
    Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/copyartifact/)
2.  Create a new job that you will trigger manually only when needed
3.  Configure this job with a build parameter of type "Build selector
    for Copy Artifact", and a copy artifact build step using "Specified
    by build parameter" to select the build.
4.  Add a post-build action to deploy the artifact that was copied from
    the other job

Now when you trigger this job you can enter the build number (or use any
other available selector) to select which build to redeploy. Thanks to
Helge Taubert for this idea.
