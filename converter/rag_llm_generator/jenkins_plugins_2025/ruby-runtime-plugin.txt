See https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+plugin+development+in+Ruby for other dependencies

1. switch to JRuby
    $ rvm jruby
2. build the plugin with maven
    $ mvn install

If ./src/main/resources/ruby/vendor directory doesn't exist, Maven will run "bundle install".
But otherwise it'll skip it for efficiency.
