# OpenEdge Plugin for Jenkins

This plugin lets you manage OpenEdge installations across different agents. Once installed, you can add OpenEdge installations on the main Jenkins configuration page.

Configure [OpenEdge ABL](https://www.progress.com/openedge) tools location on Jenkins nodes.

## What it does

During a build, this plugin will:

* Export the DLC environment variable, pointing to the installed OpenEdge tool
* Add the path $DLC/bin to the PATH, so that the tools are available during the build

## Setup

### Global configuration

1. In the tools settings (Manage Jenkins -> Global Tool Configuration), find the "OpenEdge Installations" section and click "Add OpenEdge".
2. Enter a name, e.g. "OpenEdge 12.0" - the name itself has no significance, but will be displayed to users during job configuration
3. Type the installation directory (or leave it blank if OpenEdge is not installed on the master server)

### Node configuration

1. In the node settings (select node -> Configuration), check "Tools location" (if unchecked)
2. Each OpenEdge installation configured globally can be overridden in the slave

## Per-job configuration

### Freestyle

1. In a job's configuration, find the "Build environment" section
2. Select the "Set up OpenEdge" checkbox
3. Select the OpenEdge version you want to use when this job is built

### Pipeline

As with any other type of Tool Installer, you can use the tool step to inject the DLC variable.
