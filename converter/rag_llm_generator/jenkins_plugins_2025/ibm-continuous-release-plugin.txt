# IBM Continuous Release

---

With this Jenkins plugin, you can run Jenkins jobs as a part of a deployment plan in IBM Continuous Release (CR) and Composite Pipeline.  You can run jobs that will trigger the creation of a version in the Composite Pipeline as well as persist properties on that version that can be used as input properties in other Jenkins builds.  This plugin will pass along important data from Git to the Composite Pipeline.

# Detailed Functionality

* **Posting job metadata to your Continuous Release instance -** As you create and edit jobs, the metadata for the jobs will uploaded including the names of the jobs as well as the names of parameters.  This is done so that the jobs can be invoked from the Continuous Release service within the CR security model.

* **Invoke jobs from Continuous Release -** An authenticated, encrypted persistent connection is established with the CR service so that you can trigger off jobs and pipelines with no special firewall configuration.

* **Updates status of running jobs -** You will receive instant feedback in the CR service with links to the execution.

* **Job Executions can create versions in Composite Pipeline -** You will have the option to select Jenkins jobs as "input jobs" which will create a version with special properties that you can specify.

* **Detects quality data provided by IBM Deployment Risk Analytics -** If you use the capabilities found in the IBM Cloud DevOps plugin to provide data to IBM DRA, then this plugin will forward that data to your composite pipeline to visualize quality data across your whole suite of applications.
