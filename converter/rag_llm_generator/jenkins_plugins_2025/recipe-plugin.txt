TODO:
 - if recipe requires some plugins which in turn requires a restart,
   user needs to be guided through the restart process.
   
   - I need asynchronous screen update scheme that Jesse implemented here.

 - we allow the job names to be changed during import.
   Any way to update references to them? (job names in a view, upstream/downstream references, ...)

 - Turn a build parameter into an import parameter

Plugin installation UI
