This plugin records disk usage.

# Configuration

Showing disk usage trend graph is optional - unselect the `Show disk usage trend graph` checkbox on the global configuration page (`Manage Jenkins` -> `System configuration`) if you don't want to see the graph on the project page.

# Usage

When you install this plugin, disk usage is calculated every 6 hours. You can see project list with occupied disk space by going to the "Disk Usage" page in the management section (`Manage Jenkins` -> `Disk Usage`). The same page also allows you to schedule disk usage calculation immediately.
