# htmlresource
Jenkins HTML Resource plugin

This plugin allow managing webjars for javascript and css libraries from within Jenkins
Currently there is no easy way to add a javascript or css library to jenkins to use them for theming, creating custom widgets etc.

Below are a few screenshots of how the plugin works, (I borrowed many concepts from the scriptler plugin)

This screenshot shows that the plugin provides a new management like called 'Manage HTML resources' for managing webjars

Below is a screenshot of jquery webjar. The initialization script is optional. It can be used to ad custom javascript code to the header. 
In the screenshot below some custom initialization code has been added to prevent jQuery from conflicting with prototype.js
