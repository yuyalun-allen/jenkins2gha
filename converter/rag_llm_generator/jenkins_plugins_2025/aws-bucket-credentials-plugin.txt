# aws-bucket-credentials-plugin

This is a jenkins plugin to retrieve encrypted credentials from an Amazon S3 bucket that is encrypted with KMS

The variables are:

| variable            | description                                                                                         | required |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
|username             | the username to use with these credentials                                                          | yes      |
|region               | the region to use for aws                                                                           | yes      | 
|bucketName           | the name of the bucket in s3                                                                        | yes      |
|bucketPath           | the object id within the bucket where the encrypted value where the cipher text should be read from | yes      |
|isS3Proxy            | use the proxy when doing s3 requests                                                                | no - off |
|EncryptionContextKey | if you set any context when encrypting the secret, set the key here                                 | no       |
|EncryptionValue      | the value to use along with the encryption context key                                              | no       |
|isKmsProxy           | use the proxy when doing kms requests                                                               | no - off |
|proxyHost            | the proxy host name (no protocol)                                                                   | no       |

KMS is used to decrypt the cipher text
You can optionally provide a context key and value within the script if you used this to encrypt with.

If you check the avoid KMS flag then you do not provide a KMS secret. Instead it gets the secret directly from the S3 bucket.
Use this only if you have server-side encryption enabled on the S3 bucket or your secret will be exposed.
