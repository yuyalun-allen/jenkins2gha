This plugin provides a shared dependency on the `com.jcraft:jsch` JAR -
using this plugin will eliminate the classloader problems caused by
having multiple copies of jsch loaded.**This plugin is not meant to be
used by end users by itself.**

It's supposed to be included through the dependencies of other plugins,
which want to use JSch library with support for SSH Credentials plugin.
