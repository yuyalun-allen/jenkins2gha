# Jenkins integration plugin for Jira Service Management

Use the Jenkins plugin to integrate with Jira Service Management and forward Jenkins build alerts. Jira Service Management determines the right people to notify based on their on-call schedules, notifies them via email, text messages (SMS), phone calls, and mobile push notifications (both iOS and Android), and escalates alerts until they’re acknowledged or closed.

:warning: If the feature isn’t available on your site, keep checking Jira Service Management for updates.
