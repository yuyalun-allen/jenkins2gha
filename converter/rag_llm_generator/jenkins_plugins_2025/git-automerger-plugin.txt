The main purpose of this plugin is to ensure that all newer versions include all the changes from older versions.

### Requirements

The plugin is merging only the branches with the following structure:
```
*  master
|
| * release/2.0
|/
|
| * release/1.5
|/
|
| * release/1.0
|/
```

The naming of release branches is flexible, but the branch name must contain a version number.
Versions are ordered using [Apache's ComparableVersion](https://github.com/apache/maven/blob/master/maven-artifact/src/main/java/org/apache/maven/artifact/versioning/ComparableVersion.java).

**Warning:** Do not use the plugin if your version system differs from `ComparableVersion`.
The plugin can merge newer package into older.

If you are using a different branch strategy, please fill a feature request.

### Conflicts

In many cases merge conflicts can be solved automatically.
You could define one of available conflict resolution per file.

<p>For example you have conflict:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>release/1.0</th>
        <th>release/1.1</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Foo</td>
        <td>Bar</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>According to selected resolution, one of outcome could be:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>KEEP_OLDER</th>
        <th>KEEP_NEWER</th>
        <th>MERGE_NEWER_TOP</th>
        <th>MERGE_OLDER_TOP</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Foo</td>
        <td>Bar</td>
        <td>Bar<br/>Foo</td>
        <td>Foo<br/>Bar</td>
    </tr>
</table>

For example, for `CHANGELOG.md` you would probably prefer to use `MERGE_NEWER_TOP`

### Example:
```groovy
gitAutomerger logLevel: 'INFO',
              mergeRules: [
                  [path: 'CHANGELOG.md', resolution: 'MERGE_NEWER_TOP'],
                  [path: 'version', resolution: 'KEEP_NEWER'],
              ],
              releaseBranchPattern: 'release/%',
              checkoutFromRemote: true,
              remoteName: 'origin',
              detailConflictReport: true
```
