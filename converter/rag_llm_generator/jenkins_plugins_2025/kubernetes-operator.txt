## What's the Jenkins Operator?

The Jenkins Operator is a [Kubernetes Native Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) which manages operations for Jenkins on Kubernetes.
It has been built with Immutability and declarative Configuration as Code in mind.


## Preliminaries

Considering that this Operator is created for managing instances for Jenkins,
it is important to understand what
- [Jenkins Pipelines](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/) and
- CasC ([Configuration as Code](https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin)) are.

Jenkins Pipelines use Scripts written in [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/) which aid in the CasC aspect of Jenkins.

Jenkins uses [plugins](https://plugins.jenkins.io/) like CasC to extend it's solution space by carrying out Jobs of different kinds and providing a composable infrastructure for your CI/CD.

### Out of the box it provides:
- Integration with Kubernetes ([Jenkins kubernetes-plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin))
- Pipelines as Code ([Jenkins pipelines](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/))
- Extensibility via Groovy Scripts (similar to [Jenkins script console](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+Script+Console)) or ([configuration as code plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin))
- Secure Defaults and Hardening (see [the security section](https://jenkinsci.github.io/kubernetes-operator/docs/security/) of the documentation)

## Problem statement and goals

The main reason why we decided to implement the **Jenkins Operator** is the fact that we faced a lot of problems with standard Jenkins deployment.
We want to make Jenkins more robust, suitable for dynamic and multi-tenant environments.

Some of the problems we want to solve:
- [installing plugins with incompatible versions or security vulnerabilities](https://jenkinsci.github.io/kubernetes-operator/docs/getting-started/latest/customizing-jenkins/#install-plugins/)
- [better configuration as code](https://jenkinsci.github.io/kubernetes-operator/docs/getting-started/latest/customizing-jenkins/)
- [security and hardening out of the box](https://jenkinsci.github.io/kubernetes-operator/docs/security/)
- [make errors more visible for end users](https://jenkinsci.github.io/kubernetes-operator/docs/troubleshooting/)
- orphaned jobs with no JNLP connection
- handle graceful shutdown properly
- proper end to end tests for Jenkins lifecycle

## Community
Main channel of communication on topics related to Jenkins Operator is [Jenkins Operator Category](https://community.jenkins.io/c/contributing/jenkins-operator/20) on [Jenkins Community Discourse](https://community.jenkins.io/).

Here you can ask questions about the project, discuss best practices on using it, and talk to other users of the Operator, contributors and project's maintainers.

We also have a [gitter](https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/kubernetes-operator)/[matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#jenkinsci_kubernetes-operator:gitter.im) channel, come to say hi!

## Snapshots between releases

We are trying our best to resolve issues quickly, but they have to wait to be released. If you can't wait for an official
docker image release and acknowledge the risk, you can use our unofficial images, which are built nightly.

You can find the project's Quay.io repository [here](https://quay.io/organization/jenkins-kubernetes-operator).

Look for the images with tag "{git-hash}", where {git-hash} is the hash of the master commit that interests you.
