# Jenkins Mber Plugin #

This is a [Jenkins][] plugin that allows you to notify [Mber][] about build
status.

## Building ##

This plugin depends on [Maven][] being installed.

~~~bash
mvn install
~~~

## Development ##

### Vagrant ###

If you have [VirtualBox][] and [Vagrant][] installed, you can run a local
Jenkins server for testing. The included Vagrantfile installs the latest version
of Jenkins. You can point a browser at 192.168.56.10:8080 to see your server.

~~~bash
vagrant up
~~~

Once the Jenkins server is up, you'll need to manually install the pugin.

### NetBeans ###

If you're using [NetBeans][] you can open and run the project directly. This
will start up a local Jenkins server on port 8080 for testing. The server will
already have the plugin installed.
