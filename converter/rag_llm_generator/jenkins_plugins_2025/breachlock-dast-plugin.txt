# Breachlock DAST Jenkins Plugin


This is a fully integrated Jenkins plugin for Breachlock's Dynamic Application Scanner (DAST).

Our DAST supports, but is not limited to the following:

 1. AI-enabled deep web scans.
 2. OWASP Top 10 Coverage.
 3. Authenticated Scans.
 4. A fast and accurate crawler.
 5. API Security Scanning.
 6. Online Support by Security Experts.

## Requirements

### Prerequisite
To use the DAST-plugin the following requirements needs to be satisfied:
 1. You will need an account with our [SaaS solution](https://app.breachlock.com/).
 2. After onboarding you will need to supply us with your online assets.
 3. Obtain the Jenkins integration API key unique to your company.

### Obtaining your API key
After logging in your API key can be found on the Breachlock Platform under:

`Organization settings > Integrations > Jenkins`

Should you in the future wish to review your API key or decide you no longer want the integration with Jenkins to be active you can always revisit the panel.

## Setting up the plugin

After installing the plugin you can now add the DAST functionality to **freestyle projects**.

Go to the `configuration options` of your desired project and as a build step add the **Breachlock DAST scan** plugin.

If both fields are validated by our platform we will supply you with a list of registered assets from our platform.

If the asset you are looking for is missing:

 1. Make sure it's registered on the Breachlock Platform.
 2. Check if your Jenkins installation can connect to https://app.breachlock.com/.
 3. Contact support if the problem keeps persisting.

  Finally use "Register to Breachlock" to ensure that your Jenkins installation can communicate freely with our SaaS platform.

## Starting a scan
An automated scan will start every time a project with the DAST plugin is build. You control when a project is build, so you control when a scan is performed.

Make sure the selected asset is **publicly available** before engaging in a DAST scan.

On each stage of the scan you will be notified by email on the e-mail address provided in the project setup. After completion you can log in to the Breachlock platform to download the full report.
