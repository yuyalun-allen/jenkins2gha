= Sentry plugin


The Sentry plugin helps report errors and warnings from Jenkins into
link:https://sentry.io[Sentry].


== Configuration

Currently the plugin doesn't have any user-visible configuration and relies on
the conventional `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable to determine where to send
Sentry events.
