# Redpen - Pipeline Reporter for Jira

## Introduction
Redpen Jenkins plugin is an open-sourced plugin that is used to integrate Jenkins with [Jira Software](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira). The Redpen Jenkins plugin provides an easy and secure way to send the information of failure build from Jenkins server to your Jira sites. The pipeline reports the failure status of the build and deployment with meaningful data directly into the Jira issues which helps your team to track and collaborate on the work.

## Benefits
 - This plugin integration gives visibility to your team of the CI/CD pipelines related to Jira issues.

 - The plugin reports the build and deployment-related data directly to the Jira issues. So, it is **important** that the branch that triggers the Jenkins pipeline **must have the Jira ticket number in the branch name.** (e.g. [TEST-1234] Deploy v1.2 to production)

 - The plugin eliminates the manual work required by **Software Engineers** to update the Jira issues with the pipeline details.
 
 - The plugin provides visibility to **Product Managers**, **Team Leads**, and **QA Engineers** into the pipeline like failing builds, tests, and deployments.

1. Install Redpen for Jenkins add-on from Jira Marketplace.
