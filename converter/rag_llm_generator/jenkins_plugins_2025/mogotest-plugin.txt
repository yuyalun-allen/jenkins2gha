Mogotest Jenkins Plugin
=======================

This plugin allows you to trigger a test run on the [Mogotest](http://mogotest.com/) [Web Consistency Testing](http://webconsistencytesting.com/)
service.  It will be triggered as a post-build test and you will be notified by results via email.

The primary goal of the plugin is to test any changes you've made to your web site or app after you've deployed
the changes out to either production or a staging environment.  This plugin is most valuable as an aide in continuous
deployment.

Requirements
------------

* An active Mogotest account
* A Jenkins installation

Usage
-----

There is no global configuration for the plugin.  Its entire configuration is done per-job and is available as a post-build
action.
