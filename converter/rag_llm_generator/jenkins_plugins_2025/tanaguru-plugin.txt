# JenkinsTanguruPlugin
Digital accessibility tests can be added to a continuous integration platform by launching Tanaguru Engine tests, using Tanaguru Jenkins. Tanaguru Jenkins is a Jenkins plugin allowing to pilot Tanaguru Engine via its REST API(using JSON format). It allows Jenkins to integrate Tanaguru Engine's digital accessibility tests in its tests workflow.
