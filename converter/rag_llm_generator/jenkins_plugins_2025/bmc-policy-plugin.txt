# Jenkins Plugin for Poliy Service Connectors

## Synopsis
The connector Plugin integrates Jenkins with BMC Policy Service connectors. This plugin adds a build step and a post-build action that can be configured to invoke the policy connectors

## Motivation
It is desirable to perform some of the policy checks during the devops cycle. Jenkins being the popular tool that is used by many for build/CI integraion, it makes sense to add hooks to jenkins for invoking BMC policy service checks.

## Getting Started
To get started you can clone the bmc-connector-jenkins-plugin repository and build with maven.

### Prerequisites
* Java 8
* [Apache Maven][maven] 3.3.9 or later

#### Build Instructions
```
* git clone https://github.com/jenkinsci/bmc-policy-plugin.git
* cd bmc-connector-jenkins-plugin
* mvn package
```
This command will build the jenkins plugin hpi file for you.

#### Installing 
1.	Go to Manage Jenkins >  Manage Plugins > Advanced
2. 	Scroll down to 'Upload Plugin' section

## Usage of BMC Policy Service Plugin

	* 	Arguments: Arguments to pass to the connector if any.	
	*	Connector resides in remote system: Check this option if the connector is running on remote system
	*	Hostname: Remote system hsotname/ip

 	*	Password: Password to use to login by ssh	
3.	Click Save
        You can add any number of connectors. If remote connector option is choosen then the plugin will use SSH to execute the connector on the remote system. All arguments are passed to the connector invocation.

### Job Configuration
