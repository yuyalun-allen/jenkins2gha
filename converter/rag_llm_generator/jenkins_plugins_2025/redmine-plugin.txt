Does this plugin require custom Redmine configuration?
------------

This plugin uses Redmine REST API - to enable it, login into your Redmine,
navigate to Administration -> Settings -> Authentication, check "Enable REST web service" and Save.

To use "Aggregate Redmine ticket metrics" you should provide API key assigned to existing Redmine user.
Login as desired user, visit http://redmine/my/account, copy key from "API access key" and paste it into job on Jenkins.
