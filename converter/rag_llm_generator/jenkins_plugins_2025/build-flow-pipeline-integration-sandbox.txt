Build Flow & Pipeline Integration Sandbox
=========================================
Plugin to use as a Proof-of-concept of the integration of the [build flow-](https://github.com/jenkinsci/build-flow-plugin) and the [pipeline-](http://code.google.com/p/build-pipeline-plugin/source/browse/) plugins to visualize flows scripted in the Groovy DSL in the pipeline grid.

The integration is based on Kohsuke's [change] (https://code.google.com/p/build-pipeline-plugin/source/detail?r=31b9c5b4674c13a71d63e95bd1a45d5d4bb7c4af) to the pipeline plugin that allows the data model for the ProjectGridBuild to be created in new ways.

As of 2012-03-15 v 1.3.4 of the Pipeline plugin is not yet out so a local copy to build 1.3.4-SNAPSHOT is necessary to build this project.
