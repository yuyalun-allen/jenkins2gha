Processes code coverage metrics from for
[VectorCAST](http://vector.com/vectorcast) Projects


# Summary

This is a fork of the Emma-plugin; all existing components maintain the existing license. New files are licensed under MIT. Moved or renamed files maintain their old license, and their history can be seen by looking at the source control revision logs.

This plugin allows you to capture code coverage reports from VectorCAST Projects. Jenkins will generate the trend report of coverage. This plugin is used automatically with the 
[VectorCAST Execution Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/vectorcast-execution)

Coverage information from tests runs that has been converted to XML files is read and displayed by this plugin. It shows coverage trends and allows drilling down to more detailed coverage informantion

# Usage

This plugin displays coverage and coverage trend data from running VectorCAST/Manage projects with the VectorCAST Execution Plugin. It is added as a dependency to the execution plugin and is automatically used to display coverage data.

The top page of a job will contain coverage trend graph
