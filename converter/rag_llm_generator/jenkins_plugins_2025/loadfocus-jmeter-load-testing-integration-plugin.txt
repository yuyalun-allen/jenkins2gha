[JMeter Load Testing](https://loadfocus.com/jmeter-load-testing) in the Cloud Jenkins CI/CD plugin is a Jenkins plugin for running Apache JMeter load tests continuously for Websites and APIs
 provided by <a href="https://loadfocus.com">LoadFocus</a>. 
 
Helps you run [Apache JMeter load tests](https://loadfocus.com/jmeter-load-testing) as a Post-build Action marking the Build as Passed, Unstable or Failed based on:

* **error percentage** and **response times**.
* all URLs from the test are considered when marking the status of the build.
