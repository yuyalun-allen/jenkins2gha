= SSHD Plugin

== About

This component provides a built-in SSH server for Jenkins.
It's an alternative interface for the https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/cli/[Jenkins CLI], and commands can be invoked this way using any SSH client.

NOTE: This is unrelated to https://plugins.jenkins.io/ssh-slaves/[SSH Build Agents]. In that case, the agents are the servers, and the Jenkins controller is the client.

== Configuration

Enable the built-in SSH server in _Manage Jenkins Â» Configure Global Security_.

=== Advanced Configuration

https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/system-properties/[System properties] can be used to configure hidden options.
These are generally considered unsupported, i.e. may be removed at any time.

* `org.jenkinsci.main.modules.sshd.SSHD.excludedKeyExchanges` is a comma-separated string of key exchange algorithms to disable.
  By default, this disables SHA-1 based algorithms as they're no longer considered safe.
  Use an empty string to disable no algorithms.
  The names of supported, enabled, and disabled algorithms can be viewed using the https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/system-administration/viewing-logs/[logger] `org.jenkinsci.main.modules.sshd.SSHD` during initialization on the level `FINE`.
* `org.jenkinsci.main.modules.sshd.SSHD.excludedMacs` is a comma-separated string of HMAC algorithms to disable.
  By default, this disables MD5 and truncated SHA-1 based algorithms as they're no longer considered safe.
  Use an empty string to disable no algorithms.
  The names of supported, enabled, and disabled algorithms can be viewed using the https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/system-administration/viewing-logs/[logger] `org.jenkinsci.main.modules.sshd.SSHD` during initialization on the level `FINE`.

== SSH CLI Client Authenticator for Jenkins (former ssh-cli-auth-module)
