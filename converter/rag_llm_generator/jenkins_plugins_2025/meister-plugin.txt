# Meister
Build Automation with integrated Continuous Integration

OpenMake MeisterÂ® delivers a highly reusable and accelerated build solution that can quickly adapt to changing development demands. It gives you control over the logic that drives your compile/link/archive process and eliminates the need for one-off scripts that are brittle and error prone.  It accelerates builds, relieves congestion, stores binaries and gathers critical dependency information that can be used for release packaging. OpenMake Meister can improve the functionality of any Continuous Integration process and includes OpenMake Mojo.  It supports incremental builds that creates smaller, less risky releases. Meister supports over 200 languages including Java, .Net, C, C++, and database objects.
