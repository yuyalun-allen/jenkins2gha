# Confluence Pipeline Steps Plugin (formerly "jenfluence")
Jenkins workflow plugin that is able to publish information on Atlassian Confluence pages.

Currently, the only feature is to create or retrieve a page via the Confluence REST API.

Our future plans are to extend the plugin so that only certain areas on a page can be updated or information can be inserted at specified markers. The deletion of pages and the publishing of other plugin data such as checkstyle, findbugs, javadoc or jacoco mark further milestones.

Please consult the plugin [wiki page](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Confluence+Steps+Pipeline+Plugin).

If you need a plugin for "normal" jobs or our pipeline steps are not what you were looking for, have a look at [Confluence Publisher](https://plugins.jenkins.io/confluence-publisher).
