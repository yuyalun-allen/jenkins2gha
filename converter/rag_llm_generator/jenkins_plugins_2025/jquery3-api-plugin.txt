Provides https://jquery.com[jQuery 3] for Jenkins Plugins.
jQuery is -- as described on their home page -- a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things
like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API
that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the
way that millions of people write JavaScript.

This plugin contains the JS files of the latest https://jquery.com[jQuery 3] release.

== How to use the plugin

In order to use this JS library, add a maven dependency to your pom:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.jenkins.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>jquery3-api</artifactId>
  <version>[latest version]</version>
</dependency>
----

Then you can use jQuery in your jelly files using the following snippet:

[source,xml]
----
<st:adjunct includes="io.jenkins.plugins.jquery3"/>
----

[TIP]
Since Jenkins uses jQuery 1.x as well make sure to use the global symbol `jQuery3` rather than `$` when
accessing jQuery 3.x.

You can find several examples of Jenkins views that use jQuery in the
https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin[Warnings Next Generation plugin]
and in the https://github.com/jenkinsci/forensics-api-plugin[Forensics plugin].
