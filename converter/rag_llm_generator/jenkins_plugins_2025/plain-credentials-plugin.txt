# Jenkins Plain Credentials Plugin

 Allows use of plain strings and files as credentials to be passed to miscellaneous build steps.

## Description

This plugin provides two new types of credentials:

-   `FileCredentials` or *Secret file*:

![SecretFile screenshot 1](/docs/images/secretFile.png "SecretFile screenshot 1")

-   `StringCredentials` or *Secret text*:

![SecretText screenshot 1](/docs/images/secretText.png "SecretText screenshot 1")

## Usage

These credentials were originally designed to be used together with the [Credentials Binding Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials-binding).
See the [plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials-binding) for an example use case.

However, as described in the [Credentials Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials) documentation, they could potentially be used by any other plugin that requires them.
