# Pipeline: Multibranch

## Introduction

Enhances Pipeline plugin to handle branches better by automatically
grouping builds from different branches.

Automatically creates a new Jenkins job whenever a new branch is pushed
to a source code repository.  
Other plugins can define various branch types, e.g. a Git branch, a
Subversion branch, a GitHub Pull Request etc.

## Notes

To determine the branch being built - use the environment variable
`BRANCH_NAME` - e.g. `${env.BRANCH_NAME}`
