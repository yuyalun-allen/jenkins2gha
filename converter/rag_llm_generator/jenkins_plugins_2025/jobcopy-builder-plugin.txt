** To Job Name
*** Variable expressions can be used.
** Overwrite
*** Specifies whether to overwrite the destination job if it already
exists.
* Additional operations can be performed when copying.
** Enable Job: Enabling the destination job if the source job is
disabled.
** Disable Job: Disabling the destination job if the source job is

. Applies the operations to the configuration xml string.
. Create a new job with the processed configuration xml string.

[[JobcopyBuilderplugin-Extensionpoint]]
== Extension point

A new way to provide choices can be added with implementing
`+JobcopyOperation+`, overriding the following method:

[source,java]
----
public String perform(String xmlString, String encoding, EnvVars env, PrintStream logger);
----

or, with extending `+AbstractXmlJobcopyOperation+`, overriding the
following method:

[source,java]
----
abstract public Document perform(Document doc, EnvVars env, PrintStream logger);
----
