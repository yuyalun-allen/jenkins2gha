 Zapper is a Jenkins Continuous Integration system plugin that helps you run OWASP ZAP as part of your automated security
 assessment regime. The plugin can use a pre-installed version of ZAP when given the path to the ZAP installation.
 Alternatively, it can automatically download and build a version of ZAP to be used by your security tests.
