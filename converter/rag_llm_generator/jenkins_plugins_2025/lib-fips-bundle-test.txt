# fips-bundle-test

## Introduction

This library will bundle known validated BouncyCastle FIPS provider, will provide java options and bootclasspath files.
Provide test support tools for [JEP-237](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/237)

Please note more simple tests which does not need FIPS validated cryptography modules can simply use idiom to activate the system property:

```java
    @ClassRule
    public static FlagRule<String> fipsSystemPropertyRule =
            FlagRule.systemProperty("jenkins.security.FIPS140.COMPLIANCE", "true");
```

## Getting started

In order to include BouncyCastle as FIPS compliant cryptographic provider, you only need to add this to your usage of [RealJenkinsRule](https://javadoc.jenkins.io/component/jenkins-test-harness/org/jvnet/hudson/test/RealJenkinsRule.html)

```java
    @Rule public RealJenkinsRule rr = new RealJenkinsRule()
            .withFIPSEnabled();

```

To use a specific version of the bundle

```java
    @Rule public RealJenkinsRule rr = new RealJenkinsRule()
            .withFIPSEnabled(FIPSTestBundleProvider.get("version"));

```

Version can be:
- `FIPS1402BC1x.VERSION`
- `FIPS1403BC2x.VERSION`


If you need (such PCT context which need to use a fixed version) to override the version defined in the test code, the version can be overriden using:

- Env var: `ENV_VAR_KEY`
- System property: `fips.test.bundle.version`
