## Introduction
This plugin downloads Mend.io Scanner CLI and performs image scan to detect vulnerabilities and other security risks.



## Initial Configuration

Scanner requires 4 variables to be configured:
 ```
 User Email - user email
 User Key -  mend user key
 Mend URL - mend application environment
 Repositories - list of image repositories to scan from (separated by comma)
 ```

##

This plugin is defined to be run (as a build step) after a new image creation on the jenkins machine:   
According to the given repositories, for each repository the latest created image will be scanned and a summary table will be displayed. 
This table consists of vulnerabilities data with their risk and fix version (if exists).     
Also, other security risks, such as secrets detection will be presented.

* The plugin assumed the local latest image was created and still exists on the jenkins machine.
* The plugin download a dedicated scanner CLI according to the OS and the machine architecture
