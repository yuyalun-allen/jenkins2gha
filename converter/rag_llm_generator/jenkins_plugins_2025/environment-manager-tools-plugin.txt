# Introduction

The Parasoft Environment Manager plugin for Jenkins lets you rapidly
configure various actions needed for automated, continuous testing
across your software delivery pipeline. You can configure build steps
for:

-   Provisioning environments into the specific states needed for
    automated testing
-   Replicating environments and associated assets to different
    Virtualize servers, including servers dynamically-provisioned from
    Docker or other container technologies
-   Executing Parasoft test scenario jobs (tests suites that execute vs.
    specific environment configurations)
-   Destroying "dirtied" test environments to ensure that subsequent
    tests always begin with a clean slate
-   Disconnecting a Virtualize server from Environment Manager to remove
    unnecessary connections
