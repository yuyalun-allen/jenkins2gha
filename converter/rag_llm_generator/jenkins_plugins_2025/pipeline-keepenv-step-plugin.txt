= Pipeline: Keep Environment Step Plugin

== Introduction

This plugin contributes the `keepEnv` step for Jenkins Pipelines.
It is similar to the `withEnv` step, but only retains environment variables that are defined in the argument, or are "system" environment variables.

It is similar in function to the "Keep Only Specified Environment Variables" option for some build steps introduced in Jenkins 2.248.

== Getting started

The following Pipeline demonstrates how this plugin works:

----
node {
    withEnv(['foo=bar', 'baz=qux', 'PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/foo']) {
        sh 'env'
        keepEnv(['foo', 'WORKSPACE']) {
            sh 'env'
        }
    }
}
----

* The second invocation of `env` will not list `baz` or most Jenkins-contributed environment variables, like `BUILD_ID` or `NODE_NAME`.
* The variables `foo` (from the surrounding `withEnv` block), `WORKSPACE` (contributed by Jenkins), a few essential Jenkins-contributed variables, as well as system-contributed variables (like `PATH`) will still be available.
* System-contributed environment variables that are not set to be kept will be reset to their default value (`PATH` in the example) instead of being undefined.
