Jenkins SVN Revert Plugin
=========================

A plugin for Jenkins CI that automatically reverts SVN commits for a build if build status is changed from successful to unstable.

Known Limitations
-----------------
It currently only works for jobs with a **single module**, or with multiple modules from the **same repository**.
