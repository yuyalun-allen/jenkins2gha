This plugin enables various Extended Read permissions in Jenkins.

## Usage

When this plugin is installed and proper system properties are set (see below),
a new column will be added to your authorization strategy configuration (for example, Matrix Security or Project-Based Matrix Security) in the _Configure Security_ screen.
This permission grants users and groups read access to pages that would otherwise require configuration or administrative permissions.

## Supported permissions

The pages that currently support this permission are:

* Read-only access to Job configurations (`Job/ExtendedRead`)
** Available since Jenkins 1.324
** Controlled by a `hudson.security.ExtendedReadPermission` system property. The permission will be enabled if a property is set
* Read-only access to the System configuration and management pages (`Overall/SystemRead`)
** Available since Jenkins 2.222, see link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/224[JEP-224] for details
** Controlled by a `jenkins.security.SystemReadPermission` system property

## API

The plugin exposes some additional APIs which simplify usage of the extended read permissions in other plugins.
