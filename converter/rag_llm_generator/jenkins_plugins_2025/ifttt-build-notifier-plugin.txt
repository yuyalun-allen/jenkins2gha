ifttt-build-notifier
===================
A Simple Jenkins Build Status Notifier for IFTTT Maker Channel Trigger

Posts the build status to IFTTT Maker Channel to trigger actions with all other Channels available on IFTTT. For example notify build status via a tweet or add trello card or Light-up a IoT connected device.

Create an installable artifact:

1. `git clone https://github.com/jenkinsci/ifttt-build-notifier-plugin.git`
2. `cd ifttt-build-notifier`
3. `mvn clean install`
4. Install Plugin via Manage Jenkins > Plugins > Advanced > Upload ```./target/ifttt-build-notifier.hpi```
5. Restart Jenkins ([$JENKINS_URL]/restart)

Let's setup a notification trigger with following steps. This will send a direct twitter message when a build job is completed:

Login to https://ifttt.com and perform the following steps:

1. Create a new Recipe
2. Click on `this` part
2. Enter or select `Maker Channel` in `Choose Trigger Channel` 
3. Select `Receive a Web Request` in `Choose a Trigger`
4. Enter an Event name (for example `build_notification`)
5. Click on `Create Trigger` button
6. Next, click on `that` part
7. Enter or select `Twitter` in `Choose Action Channel`
8. Select `Send a direct message to yourself` in `Choose an Actin`
9. Enter following message in `Message field` in `Complete Action Fields`
```
Jenkins Build Status for Project: {{Value1}}, Build Number:{{Value2}}, Status: {{Value3}} 
```
Note: IFTTT Maker Channel `Receive a Web Request` trigger accepts three values and plugin sends Project Name as Value1, Build Number as Value2 and Status as Value3

10. Finally click on `Create Action` button
11. Give a name to newly created recipe
12. Click on `Create Recipe` button to create the recipe
13. Now, navigate to https://ifttt.com/maker
14. Copy the Key from `Your key is:` section

Back in Jenkins setup a project to send build notifications:

1. Configure a Job or Project for which you want to enable IFTTT trigger
2. Add `IFTTT Build Notifier` action from `Add Post Build Action` list
3. Enter `Event Name` specified in Step#4 above (for example `build_notification`)
4. Enter `Key` copied from Step#14 above
3. Save the configuration
4. That's it
   
Now whenever a build is triggered and completed, you will see a Twitter message with build status
