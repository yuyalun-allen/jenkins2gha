## Overview

This plugin provides access to various Compuware Topaz (R) utilities, such as submitting Jobs on the mainframe.

## Prerequisites

The following are required to use this plugin:
- Jenkins
- Jenkins Credentials Plugin
- Topaz Workbench CLI version 19.02.01 or later. Refer to the [Topaz Workbench Install Guide](https://docs.compuware.com/kb/KB2001/PDF/TopazWorkbench_Install.pdf) for instructions.
- A valid Topaz for Program Analysis, Topaz for Enterprise Data or Topaz for Total Test license
- Host Communications Interface

## Installing in a Jenkins Instance

1. Install the Compuware Topaz Utilities plugin according to the Jenkins instructions for installing plugins. Dependent plugins will automatically be installed.
2. Install the Topaz Workbench CLI on the Jenkins instances that will execute the plugin. The Topaz Workbench CLI is available in the Topaz Workbench installation package. If you do not have the installation package, please visit [support.compuware.com](https://support.compuware.com/). For Topaz Workbench CLI installation instructions, please refer to the [Topaz Workbench Install Guide](https://docs.compuware.com/kb/KB2001/PDF/TopazWorkbench_Install.pdf).

## Configuring for Topaz Workbench CLI & Host Connections

- See [Configuring for Topaz Workbench CLI & Host Connections](https://github.com/jenkinsci/compuware-common-configuration-plugin/blob/master/README.md#user-content-configuring-for-topaz-workbench-cli--host-connections)

### Submit JCL datasets or members on the mainframe

This integration allows submitting JCL datasets or members on the mainframe.

On the **Configuration** page of the job or project, in the **Build** section, from the **Add build step** list, select **Topaz submit JCL members**.

This build action has following parameters:

- **Host connection** : Select the host connection to be used to connect to the z/OS host.

![](docs/images/info.svg) Alternatively, to add a connection, click **Manage connections**. The **Host connections** section of the Jenkins configuration page appears so a connection can be added.

- **Login credentials** : Select the stored credentials to use for logging onto the z/OS host.

![](docs/images/info.svg) Alternatively, click **Add **to add credentials using the [Credentials Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials/). Refer to the Jenkins documentation for the Credentials Plugin.

Do the following:

- **Maximum condition code** :  Enter the maximum condition code or keep the default value. The submitting of JCL jobs will terminate if any job's return code is greater than the maximum condition code.

- **Dataset(member)** : List JCL dataset / dataset(member)s, each on a separate line.

If desired, repeat the steps above to add more build steps.

Click **Save**.

Run the job, which submits each specified JCL dataset or member on the mainframe.

On the **Configuration** page of the job or project, in the **Build** section, from the **Add build step** list, select **Topaz submit free-form JCL**.

This build action has following parameters:

- **Host connection** : Select the host connection to be used to connect to the z/OS host.

- **Login credentials** : Select the stored credentials to use for logging onto the z/OS host.

![](docs/images/info.svg) Alternatively, click **Add **to add credentials using the [Credentials Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials/). Refer to the Jenkins documentation for the Credentials Plugin.

Do the following:

- **Maximum condition code** :  Enter the maximum condition code or keep the default value. The submitting of JCL jobs will terminate if any job's return code is greater than the maximum condition code.

- **JCL** : Enter JCL statements.

If desired, repeat the steps above to add more build steps.

Click **Save**.

Run the job, which submits the entered JCL on the mainframe.

## Using Pipeline Syntax to Generate Pipeline Script

- Do one of the following:

    - When working with an existing Pipeline job, click the **Pipeline Syntax** link in the left panel. The **Snippet Generator** appears.

    - When configuring a Pipeline job, click the **Pipeline Syntax** link at the bottom of the **Pipeline **configuration section. The **Snippet Generator** appears.

- **Sample Step** : Select **General Build Step** .

- **Build Step** : Select **Topaz submit JCL members** or **Topaz submit free-form JCL**.

- Complete the displayed fields.

- Click **Generate Pipeline Script**. The Groovy script to invoke the step appears. The script can be added to the Pipeline section when configuring a Pipeline job. A sample script is shown below:

~~~
stage("Submit JCL Members") {
    node {
        step([$class: 'topazSubmitJclMembers',
        connectionId: '0274970b-bade-48c1-b726-a95b84c4abbb', 
        credentialsId: '0f6dbaa8-2cac-4968-a67b-fc97819ec413', 
        jclMember: '''A.B.JCL1
        A.B.JCL2
        A.B.JCL3(MEMBER)''', 
        maxConditionCode: '4'])
    }
}
~~~

## Known Limitations

-   The browser default header size may not be suitable when submitting large free-form JCL. This can be remedied by modifying the jenkins.xml file located at the root of where your Jenkins is installed. Update the jenkins.xml arguments as follows:
    - Modify the Jenkins service arguments, but adding, or changing if already present, argument: **requestHeaderSize**; a sample of the arguments is shown below:

~~~
<arguments>-Xrs -Xmx256m -Dhudson.lifecycle=hudson.lifecycle.WindowsServiceLifecycle 
-jar "%BASE%\jenkins.war" --httpPort=8080 --webroot="%BASE%\war" --requestHeaderSize=128000</arguments>
