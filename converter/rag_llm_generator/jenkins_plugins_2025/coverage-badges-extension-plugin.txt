## Introduction

This plugin is an extension of the [embeddable-build-status](https://plugins.jenkins.io/embeddable-build-status/). It adds the ability to display coverage metrics badges for jobs and pipeline recording coverage using [coverage plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/coverage/) 

## Usage

The plugin offer new placeholders to display coverage badges in the build status badge.

It works only when the job or pipeline is reporting the coverage using `recordCoverage` step from the [coverage plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/coverage/)

Following placeholder are

- `instructionCoverage` : Display the instruction coverage percentage
- `branchCoverage` : Display the branch coverage percentage
- `lineOfCode` : Display the total line of code
- `numberOfTest` : Display the number of test
- `colorInstructionCoverage`: Display the color of the instruction coverage
- `colorBranchCoverage`: Display the color of the branch coverage

For example a coverage badge can be displayed like this

`<instanceUrl>/buildStatus/icon?job=job&subject=Coverage&status=${instructionCoverage}&color=${colorInstructionCoverage}`

It will render a badge like this (example with 50% coverage)

![coverage badge](./doc/coverage-badge.svg)

Or for the total line of code

`<instanceUrl>/buildStatus/icon?job=test&status=${lineOfCode}&subject=line%20of%20code&color=blue`

It will render a badge like this

![line of code badge](./doc/line-of-code-badge.svg)

Or even the number of test

`<instanceUrl>/buildStatus/icon?job=test&status=${numberOfTest}&subject=Tests&color=brightgreen`

It will render a badge like this

![number of test badge](./doc/number-of-test.svg)

Please refer to the [embeddable-build-status](https://plugins.jenkins.io/embeddable-build-status/) for more information about the different URL to access the badges.

## Example declarative Pipeline

If the Jenkins controller has a tool configured for "maven-3.9.6" and "jdk-21" and has the appropriate plugins installed, the following declarative Pipeline provides a working example:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent {
        label '!windows'
    }
    tools {
        maven 'maven-3.9.6'
        jdk 'jdk-21'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/jenkinsci/platformlabeler-plugin.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build & Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn -P enable-jacoco clean verify'
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        always {
            recordCoverage tools: [[pattern: 'target/site/jacoco/jacoco.xml']]
            echo 'Coverage results embeddable build status build URL is:\n' +
                 env.BUILD_URL + '/badge/icon' +
                 '?subject=Coverage&status=${branchCoverage}&color=${colorBranchCoverage}'
            echo 'Coverage results embeddable build status job URL is:\n' +
                 env.JOB_URL + '/badge/icon' +
                 '?subject=Coverage&status=${branchCoverage}&color=${colorBranchCoverage}'
        }
    }
}
```
