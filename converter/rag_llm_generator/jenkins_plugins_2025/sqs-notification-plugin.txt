# Jenkins Instructions

1. Create an [AWS SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) queue.
1. Install this plugin on your Jenkins server.
1. Configure this plugin.
1. **Add it as a Post-build action** in your Jenkins job.

It will send a message to your specified AWS SQS queue in the following format:

```
{
    "QueueUrl": "https://queue.amazonaws.com/1234567890/your-queue",
    "MessageBody": "Configurable job message",
    "MessageAttributes": {
        "user": {
            "DataType": "String",
            "StringValue": "Jenkins"
        },
        "room": {
            "DataType": "String",
            "StringValue": "#off-topic"
        }
    },
    "DelaySeconds": 0
}
