app.io-plugin
=============

Jenkins CI plugin for App.io: uploads iOS simulator builds to App.io (via AWS S3 service) so that a live simulator link is available on the main project page. See the [jenkins-ci.org wiki page](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/App.io+Plugin) for more details.

## Unit Testing
To run unit tests, you will need to set a number of test properties to define the App.io and Amazon S3 credentials to use and other test parameters.  The property file for the tests is test.properties: there is a blank template provided in the repo, add your test properties and rename to test.properties.  These tests are skipped when running release:perform, so there is no dependency on the local test.properties.

Warning: unit tests will over-write any existing App.io deployments with the same name - please use a different app name (Appio.appName).


### App.io Test Properties
1. Appio.appName=name for app on App.io
2. Appio.apiKeyUnencoded=App.io API key from https://app.io/account/api
3. Appio.badKey=An unrecognized API key
4. Appio.badName=An unrecognized app name: make sure app does not exist

### Amazon S3 Test Properties 
1. S3.accessKey=AWS Access Key
2. S3.secretKey=AWS Secret Key
3. S3.bucketName=AWS S3 Bucket
4. S3.badBucket=An unrecognized S3 bucket: make sure bucket does not exist
5. S3.keyName=An unrecognized AWS Access Key
6. S3.uploadFile=Path to zipped .app package to use for testing: just zip up any successful simulator build
7. S3.badFile=An unrecognized filepath
