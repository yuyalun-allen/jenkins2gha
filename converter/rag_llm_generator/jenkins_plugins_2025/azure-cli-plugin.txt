# Azure CLI Jenkins Plugin

A Jenkins plugin to use Azure CLI for managing Azure resources.

:exclamation: This is NOT an official Microsoft plugin

:star2: The advantage of this plugin that it let's you export the CLI result from each command to environment variables and to the next command.

## How to Install

You can install/update this plugin in Jenkins update center (Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins, search Azure CLI Plugin).

You can also manually install the plugin if you want to try the latest feature before it's officially released.
To manually install the plugin:

1. Clone the repo and build:
   ```
   mvn package
   ```
2. Open your Jenkins dashboard, go to Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins.
3. Go to Advanced tab, under Upload Plugin section, click Choose File.
4. Select `azure-cli.hpi` in `target` folder of your repo, click Upload.
5. Restart your Jenkins instance after install is completed.

## Deploy & Manage Azure Resources

### Prerequisites

To use this plugin, first you need to have an Azure Service Principal in your Jenkins instance.

1. Create an Azure Service Principal through [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli?toc=%2fazure%2fazure-resource-manager%2ftoc.json) or [Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal).
2. Open Jenkins dashboard, go to Credentials, add a new Microsoft Azure Service Principal with the credential information you just created.
3. Install [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) in the Jenkins Host

## How to use

1. Select Azure CLI Plugin in the Build Steps.
2. Select the Azure Service Principal
3. Type a command such as ```az vm create -n MyLinuxVM -g MyResourceGroup --image UbuntuLTS --data-disk-sizes-gb 10 20```
4. You can also use environment variables: ```az vm create -n ${VM_NAME} -g MyResourceGroup --image UbuntuLTS --data-disk-sizes-gb 10 20 ```

### Export output as environment variables

The CLI command output is JSON based:

Output:

  ```javascript
     {
         "fqdns": "",
         "id": "/subscriptions/some-guid/resourceGroups/MyResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/MyLinuxVM",
         "location": "northeurope",
         "macAddress": "00-0D-AA-AA-AA-AA",
         "powerState": "VM running",
         "privateIpAddress": "10.0.0.4",
         "publicIpAddress": "52.178.0.0",
         "properties": {
            "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
         },
         "resourceGroup": "MyResourceGroup"
}

  ```
  
  If you want to export a property to an environment variable that you can use in other build steps, define the parameters in the "advanced" section:
  1. `/publicIpAddress|PUBLIC_IP` The '/publicIpAddress' is the path in the JSON and the 'PUBLIC_IP' is the environment variable that will be created. 
  2. Nested property: `/properties/provisioningState|STATE`
  3. Multiple environment variables: `/publicIpAddress|PUBLIC_IP , /properties/provisioningState|STATE`

## Deploy using Pipeline

You can also use this plugin in pipeline (Jenkinsfile). Here are some samples to use the plugin in pipeline script:

To create a new resource group and provision a new VM:

```groovy
azureCLI commands: [[exportVariablesString: '', script: 'az group create -n MyResourceGroup --location northeurope'], [exportVariablesString: '/publicIpAddress|PUBLIC_IP', script: 'az vm create -n ${VM_NAME} -g MyResourceGroup --image UbuntuLTS --data-disk-sizes-gb 10 20']], principalCredentialId: '<credential_id>'
```

For advanced options, you can use Jenkins Pipeline Syntax tool to generate a sample script.

## Deploy using Job DSL

You can also use this plugin with using the Jobs DSL. For example:

To create a linux VM using the CLI:

```groovy
job('AzCommand') {
  steps {
        azCommands('servicePrincipalId', 
                        ['az vm create -n MyLinuxVM -g MyResourceGroup --image UbuntuLTS --data-disk-sizes-gb 10 20 && /publicIpAddress|PUBLIC_IP'])
    }
}
```
