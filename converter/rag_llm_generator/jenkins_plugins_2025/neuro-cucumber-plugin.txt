# NeuroCucumberPlugin

This plugin enables Jenkins to integrate with neuro for jobs that are running Cucumber test suites. It allows you to create an Automation dashpad in neuro that visualizes test results over time, producing charts and metrics with which you can measure quality. The main mechanism behind the plugin is that it sends a webhook with the cucumber results JSON file every time there has been a new job run. This means that the visuals always stay up to date and represent the data in the moment. Check out the user manual https://app.myneuro.ai/manual/automationModule for a detailed guide in making this integration.

Thanks for using neuro!
