# SmileHub Notification Plugin for Jenkins

## Usage

### Pipeline

You can use it in the Workflow/Pipeline DSL, with the global default channel:
```
node {
    try {
     ...
    } catch (e) {
        smilehubSend message: 'test'
        throw e
    }
}
```

The message looks then like this:

![sampel message](smilehub_sample_message.png)

It also works with normal jobs:

## Admin settings

You can define a default notification channel:
