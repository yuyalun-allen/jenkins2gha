# Red Hat Application Migration Toolkit
Red Hat Application Migration Toolkit is a collection of open 
source tools that enables large-scale application migrations and modernizations.
The tools provide support for each step of the migration process. 
The main supported migrations consist of:
* Application platform upgrade
