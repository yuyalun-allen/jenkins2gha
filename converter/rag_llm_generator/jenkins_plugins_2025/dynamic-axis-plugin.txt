# Jenkins Dynamic Axis Plugin

This plugin allows you to define a matrix build axis that is dynamically 
populated from an environment variable. Variables can be contributed to a 
build from a number of places, including:

- Build parameters
- Build node configuration
- Jenkins configuration
- System environment

See [DynamicAxis Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/DynamicAxis+Plugin) for more information.
