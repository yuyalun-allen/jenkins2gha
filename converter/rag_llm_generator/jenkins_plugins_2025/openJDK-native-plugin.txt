# OpenJDK Native Plugin

This plugin adds auto installer for OpenJDK from native RPM packages and provides switching between OpenJDK vesrions using Linux alternatives.


## Configuration

Add Java installation, select `Install automatically` and choose OpenJDK installer:

![OpenJDK Installer](images/openJDKInstaller.png "OpenJDK installer")

Select RPM package, which you want to install:

![RPM selection](images/openJDKInstaller_rpm.png "RPM selection")

`Alternatives` and `yum` are run via `sudo`, therefore appropriate sudoers setup is requited (including switching off tty requirement which is turned on by default or run pseudo-tty e.g. by including `-t` param in `ssh` command).

Example setup:

**/etc/sudoers.d/jenkins**

```
#Defaults    requiretty
User_Alias JENKINS = test_user
Cmnd_Alias OPENJDK_INSTALL = /usr/sbin/alternatives, /usr/bin/yum
JENKINS ALL = NOPASSWD: OPENJDK_INSTALL
```
