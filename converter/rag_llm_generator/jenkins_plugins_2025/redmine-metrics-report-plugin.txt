#### Note: In order to allow Jenkins to run html page with javascript, You have to set the following script in Jenkins script console and clean browser cache. This setup won't survive after Jenkins service restart, so you have to set it again and clean browser cache.
```
System.setProperty("hudson.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.CSP", "")
```
