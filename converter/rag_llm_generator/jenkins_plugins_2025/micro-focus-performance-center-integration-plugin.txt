Using this plugin, you can:
- Upload LoadRunner and JMeter scripts from a GitHub repository or a GitLab project to a project on a LoadRunner Enterprise server.
- Create LoadRunner Enterprise tests from a YAML file.
- Run a LoadRunner Enterprise test from its ID, or create it from a YAML file or YAML syntax and then run it.

There is a separate plugin for running performance tests using LoadRunner Enterprise. For details, see [OpenText Application Automation Tools](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Micro+Focus+Application+Automation+Tools) - [LoadRunner Enterprise Integration](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Performance+Center+Integration).

## Versions

### Version 1.0.0
This version provides the following enhancements:

**Git synchronization**

- Ability to synchronize LoadRunner Enterprise with Git by uploading LoadRunner and JMeter scripts stored in a Git repository to a LoadRunner Enterprise project.

### Version 1.1.0
This version provides the following enhancements:
- Git Synchronization: Ability to create a LoadRunner Enterprise test from YAML files stored in Git.
- Test Execution: Ability to create a test (from a YAML file or YAML content) before running it.

### Version 1.1.1
Fixed a defect relating to a tech preview feature (REST API usage of Load Generator and Controller for dynamic provisioning).

### Version 1.1.2
This version provides the following enhancements:
- Network Virtualization Insights report is published in the Build's logs (this works with LoadRunner Enterprise but requires a hotfix in all Performance Center versions).
- Rebranded the product name from "Performance Center" to "LoadRunner Enterprise", "PC" to "LRE", and "My PC" to "LoadRunner Enterprise Application".

### Version 1.1.3
This version provides the following enhancements:
- Fix for Java 11.
- Connect to LoadRunner Enterprise 2020 SP2 and later with a tenant.

### Version 1.1.4
This version provides the following enhancements:
- Fix for pipeline build (FreeStyle project works fine): 
  - problem: While the first build passes and synchronizes everything, subsequent builds, supposed to only synchronize the changes in the Git repository, cannot calculate the difference and fail.
  - Resolution: All pipeline builds now behave as if they are the first build and will synchronize everything.
- Added support for LoadRunner Developer scripts (DevWeb protocol): A folder containing both the "main.js" and "rts.yml" files is considered a LoadRunner Developer script.
- Added support for Gatling scripts: A folder containing a file with ".scala" for extension is considered a Gatling script.
- This plugin does not fail the build if there are failed attempts to synchronize "LoadRunner Developer" and Gatling scripts because there are many versions of Performance Center and LoadRunner Enterprise that do not support those scripts.
- Additional rebranding (changing "Performance Center" to "LoadRunner Enterprise" in the build logs).

### Version 1.1.5
This version provides the following enhancements:
- Ability to use an LoadRunner Enterprise token API access key associated with a user for authentication (available in LoadRunner Enterprise 2021 R1 and later).
- Added support for Selenium script (available from LoadRunner Enterprise 2021 R1 and later). A folder containing a file with ".java" extension and containing the expression "import org.openqa.selenium" is considered Selenium script.
- Fixed a defect caused by the plugin trying to validate a Linux OS system path according to Windows OS criteria and vice versa, when the Jenkins server and the remote agent are on a different OS type.

### Version 1.1.6
This version provides the following enhancements:
- Rebranding from Micro Focus to OpenText.
- Possibility to associate a YAML defined test to a trend report.
- Possibility to search for a timeslot defined for LRE test to execute and use it.
- Possibility to add a wait time between generation of the trend report and the download of the trend report to the build artifact.
- Timeslot duration can be parametrized via two parameters (Hours and Minutes).

### Version 1.1.7
This version provides the following enhancements:
- Removing unused dependency.

## Prerequisites
1. Java version 8 or higher. To verify your Java version, go to http://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp.
2. LoadRunner Enterprise server.
3. Git Repository on GitHub or GitLab server.
4. Jenkins versions: This plugin supports only the latest five LTS versions of Jenkins (currently 2.60.3). This is a result of the Jenkins policy to no longer support older update centers. Jenkins 2.54 and higher requires you to have Java 8 installed on the machine.
5. Content Security Policy: Starting with version 1.641 (or 1.625.3), Jenkins introduced the Content-Security-Policy header. This causes some of the integration links, such as links to reports, to become inoperable. For details, see [Configuring Content Security Policy](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Configuring+Content+Security+Policy) and [Jenkins Security Advisory](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2015-12-09/) . For suggested workarounds until the issue is resolved, see [Content Security Policy Header](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Micro+Focus+Application+Automation+Tools#MicroFocusApplicationAutomationTools-ContentSecurityPolicyHeader).
6. LoadRunner Enterprise projects with Version Control enabled are not supported.
