# [Snow Software Commander](https://www.snowsoftware.com/products/snow-commander) Jenkins plugin

Snow Software provides a plugin for Jenkins automation servers (Jenkins
version 2.164.3 or greater). The Commander Jenkins plugin allows you to
configure a Jenkins build job to request virtual services and run
command workflows in a Commander instance (version 7.0.0 or greater) as
part of building, deploying and installing a project.

Using the Commander Jenkins plugin, you can add any of the following
build steps to freestyle and Pipeline jobs:

- request virtual services
- run command workflows
- wait steps to ensure that requests or workflows have sufficient time to complete

The Commander plugin enables more effective continuous integration and
delivery for improved DevOps capabilities. Using the Commander plugin
allows you to quickly add Commander build steps — you don't need to
create lengthy and complex scripts to include in your Jenkins job.

For example, with the help of the Commander plugin you can create a
Jenkins job with Commander build steps that each day would delete the
test virtual machine from the previous day, submit a service request to
deploy a new VM, and install the most recent build of your software on
the new VM.

Snow Commander multi-cloud management platform is the fastest and
easiest way to automate provisioning, enforce governance, and enable
self-service IT across virtualized, private and public cloud
infrastructures.
