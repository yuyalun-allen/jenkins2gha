#### Pipeline step

You can use typetalk step in your pipeline as well as a classic style job.
When you want to notify a build result, you can use 'typetalkSend' step with 'catchError'.

```
node {
    catchError {
        sh 'might fail'
    }
    typetalkSend name: 'ikikko test', topicId: 9260
}
```

You can also notify an event which starts and/or ends with 'withTypetalk' step.

```
withTypetalk(name: 'ikikko test', notifyEnd: true, notifyEndMessage: '', notifyStart: true, notifyStartMessage: '', topicId: 9260) {
    // some block
}
```

#### Notification URL

In order to operate Jenkins from Typetalk, you should set a certain endpoint to Typetalk bot in a topic.

### Bot for all Jenkins projects

This plugin provides the following endpoint to receive message from Typetalk. You have to set it to a webhook URL of Typetalk bot. See the official document for more.

`http://<Jenkins URL>/typetalk/notify`

Then, you can operate Jenkins by mentioning to the bot as follows:

- `@jenkins+ build <project> (<key=value>)`
- `@jenkins+ list (<regexp filter>)`
- `@jenkins+ help (<sub command>)`

In this case, @jenkins+ is your bot name here.

### Bot for a single Jenkins project

By adding project name as a parameter of webhook URL,

`http://<Jenkins URL>/typetalk/notify?project=<project>`

then you can omit the name when mentioning to Typetalk bot like this.

- `@jenkins-project+`
- `@jenkins-project+ build (<key=value>)`
