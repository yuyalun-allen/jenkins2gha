History
=======

The plugin has been originally written by Khai Do (@zaro0508) for the OpenStack
CI infrastructure. They needed a way to scale Jenkins to multiple controllers
and went with the Gearman protocol since some were familiar with it. OpenStack
eventually replaced Jenkins with Ansible and the plugin.

The Gooddata company forked it and notably added support for Jenkins Pipeline
jobs.

The Wikimedia Foundation had the use case to support Java 11. It required to
address a backware incompatible in the gearman-java library which had been
untouched since 2012.  As a commitment to the upstream Jenkins community the
old Github repository has been taken over:
* the old `master` branch has been renamed `legacy`
* The GoodData fork has been merged in
* The Java 11 incompatibility issue has been addressed

Some details can be found at https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T271683

Legacy:
* Bugs: https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/project/706
* Changes: https://review.opendev.org/q/project:x/gearman-plugin
