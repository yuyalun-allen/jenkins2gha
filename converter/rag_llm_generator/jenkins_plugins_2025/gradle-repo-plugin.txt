This plugin adds Gradle Repo (https://github.com/EastWoodYang/Gradle-Repo) as an SCM
provider for Jenkins.  Projects can use this plugin to only run builds
when changes are detected in any of the git repositories in the repo
manifest, to list the changes between builds, and to re-create the
project state across all repositories for any previous build using
a static manifest.
