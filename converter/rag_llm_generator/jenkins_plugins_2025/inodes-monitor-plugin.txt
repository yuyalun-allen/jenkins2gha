= Inodes Monitor Plugin

This plugin offers a link:http://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/hudson/node_monitors/NodeMonitor.html[NodeMonitor]
implementation for inodes.

It also offers to configure a threshold below which the node will automatically be put on/offline.

NOTE: it only works for Unix/Linux nodes where the `df` command is available.

== Details

Inodes are basically a table for the files of the filesystem.
On many Linux FS, it has a fixed size. It's *very important to monitor*, like the disk space,
because the effect is exactly the same: *if you run out of inodes, then you can't write on the disk anymore!*

And if you don't know about it, you may scratch your head quite a long time wondering why Jenkins is telling you there's no more disk space left,
when you see there's still dozens of GB available...

Basically, the plugin uses the `df` command with the POSIX portability flag:

[source,shell]
df --portability --inodes .
