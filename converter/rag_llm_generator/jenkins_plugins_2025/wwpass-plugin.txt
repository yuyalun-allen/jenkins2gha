WWPass Authentication Plugin for Jenkins CI
==============================================

Plugin for Jenkins CI implements authentication via WWPass Keyset.

*Note:* This plugin is compatible with Jenkins CI version 1.542 or higher.

### Plugin installation

* Build a plugin from the sources:

  After cloning the *jenkinsci/wwpass-plugin* repo, use Maven to make HPI package:
    cd to folder where you put the downloaded sources and run the following command:
  
    ```
    mvn package -DskipTests
    ```
    
  Go to **Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins > Advanced** and upload the recently generated .HPI file from *{sources}/target*.
  
* Install from Jenkins CI repo:

  Go to **Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins > Availiable** and search for "WWPass Authentication Plugin", check it and push one of the install buttons (according to your choice). 
  
### Plugin setup

First, you need to register at https://developers.wwpass.com and get a Service Provider's personal certificate and key pair.

Plugin searches the certificate-key pair on the following paths by default:

|                  |         Windows         |             Linux            |
|:----------------:|:-----------------------:|:----------------------------:|
| Certificate file | C:/wwpass/wwpass_sp.crt | /etc/ssl/certs/wwpass_sp.crt | 
| Key file         | C:/wwpass/wwpass_sp.key | /etc/ssl/certs/wwpass_sp.key |

You may use this paths and names. If you want to use other paths and names for these files, change it in Jenkins settings (if you use WWPass authentication as a secondary realm, change these properties in **Manage Jenkins > Configure System**, or if you use it as a primary realm &ndash; in **Manage Jenkins > Configure Global Security**).
