This plugin and its dependencies form a suite of plugins that lets you orchestrate automation, simple or
complex. See [the Jenkins Pipeline documentation](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/) for more details.

Formerly known as the Workflow plugin. Originally inspired by the discontinued [Build
Flow Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/build-flow-plugin).

## Developer Notes

Plugins that implement Pipeline steps or integrate with Pipeline-related APIs **should not depend on `workflow-aggregator`** because it includes many unncessary dependencies.
Instead, they should depend only on the plugins that provide the APIs necessary for the integration.
For the common case of implementing a Pipeline step, plugins typically only need to depend on [`workflow-step-api`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-step-api/).
In order to test Pipeline-related functionality, plugins need `test`-scope dependencies on [`workflow-job`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-job/) and [`workflow-cps`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-cps/).
Additional `test`-scope dependencies on plugins like [`workflow-durable-task-step`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-durable-task-step) or [`workflow-basic-steps`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-basic-steps) may be needed for more complex tests.
