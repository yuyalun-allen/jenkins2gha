## Introduction

Artifact Manager on Artifactory plugin is an Artifact Manager that allow you to store your artifacts into a generic repository on Artifactory.
The use of this Artifactory repository as an Artifact storage is transparent to Jenkins and your jobs, it works like the default
Artifact Manager.

This plugin is similar to [artifact-manager-s3](https://plugins.jenkins.io/artifact-manager-s3/) and 
[azure-artifact-manager](https://plugins.jenkins.io/azure-artifact-manager/) but for JFrog Artifactory as backend.

Artifact are stored in a [generic](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-artifactory-documentation/generic-repositories) repository on Artifactory.

The plugin support both OSS and Pro versions of Artifactory, but Pro version is recommended due to missing REST API on OSS edition. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Limitations of OSS edition.

- Not able to move artifact to another location when a job is renamed. Moving must be done manually from Artifactory UI (which is supported on OSS edition).
- Fail to replay a job due to cannot copy artifacts and stashes to the new location.
