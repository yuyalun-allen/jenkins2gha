Prerequisites:
- Java JDK 1.7 + Maven >= 3.0.4

Installation:

The plugin depends on libraries not available at Maven Central. To install these libraries locally, cd into the project folder and call "install-non-maven-libs". This should install all required libraries.

Next, change the settings in "src/main/resources/plug-config.properties" to the 
values used by your NetIO plug. If you don't own such a plug, skip this step.

Then, call "mvn clean install" and the plugin should create the file "plug-in.hpi" in the "target" folder. This file can be installed using the Jenkins GUI. If you do not own the plug yet, use "mvn clean install -P unit-tests-only" instead. 
If you want to test the plugin instead, run "mvn hpi:run". For this to work, you'll first have to configure your Maven settings XML file according to the tutorial found at https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Plugin+tutorial.

When installed, use the post build step "Notify the plug" to activate the plug whenever the build is broken. You can then configure which port to use. Global settings can also be modified using the Jenkins configuration menu.
