Current software products are created with the help of flexible and agile systems in a continuous integration (CI) environment. Such environments include a
CI-Server like Jenkins. The Performance Signature collects performance values during a build and evaluates and compares the result with previous builds and
non-functional requirements. Several software tests can be run and evaluated automatically, so that the most important key performance indicators (KPI) can be
summarized and be available for all project participants very quickly.

## Introduction

The Performance Signature evaluates aggregated load and performance data from Dynatrace after each build.
We are currently supporting three data sources:
* Dynatrace SaaS/Manged
* Remote Jenkins Jobs with enabled Performance Signature

Each data source has it's own Jenkins plugin, whereof each one depends on the Performance Signature UI Plugin.
Find below the documentation of each component.

* **[Performance Signature: Dynatrace SaaS/Managed](dynatrace/README.md)**
* **[Performance Signature: Dynatrace Viewer](viewer/README.md)**

## Installation
### Using Jenkins Update Center

The recommended way of installing the plugin is by using the Update Center (plugin directory). Navigate to `Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins` page and switch to the `Available` tab. Search for the keyword "Performance Signature:" and install the plugin.

### Manual Installation

This procedure is meant for developers, who want to install a locally built plugin version.

* build the plugin from source using `mvn package` command
* in Jenkins, go to the `Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins`
* switch to the `Advanced` tab
* upload the built plugin package from the `target/performance-signature-*.hpi` path to the `Upload Plugin` section
* restart Jenkins
