jython-postbuild-plugin
=======================

Jython plugin for Jenkins similar to the groovy postbuild plugin but that allows you to write the code in python (using jython to access java classes and methods)


It's a blunt copy of the groovy postbuild plugin, without the security enhancements that it has actually (that requires changing also the secure script plugin, will do with time)
