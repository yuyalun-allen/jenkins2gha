## Overview

zAdviser uses machine learning to find correlations between developer behaviors and key performance indicators (KPIs) based on DevOps data and Compuware product usage data. zAdviser captures a broad range of metrics to help teams improve quality, velocity and efficiency---including usage of specific Compuware tools and tool functions, source code management (SCM) KPIs and diverse DevOps performance parameters across teams, individual users and applications. Teams can use this intelligence to pinpoint trends and patterns that may be helping or hindering their mainframe software delivery. The plugin allows Jenkins users to extract and download zAdviser data from Compuware with option to encrypt
personal information and finally upload to Compuware for further processing.

See your data in zAdviser's highly intuitive and interactive dashboards built on Elastic's Elastic Cloud service and Kibana. You'll get instant visibility into features and functions usage, software development and delivery processes, developer productivity and code-level information to help teams make evidence-based decisions that improve development and business outcomes.

![](docs/images/info.svg) To obtain your Customer Id and zAdviser Access Key please create a new case on
[support.compuware.com](http://support.compuware.com/) requesting a new zAdviser Jenkins Plugin Access Token

## Installing in a Jenkins Instance

1. Install the Compuware zAdviser API plugin according to the Jenkins instructions for installing plugins. Dependent plugins will automatically be installed.
2. Install the Topaz Workbench CLI on the Jenkins instances that will execute the plugin. The Topaz Workbench CLI is available in the Topaz Workbench installation package. If you do not have the installation package, please visit [support.compuware.com](https://support.compuware.com/). For Topaz Workbench CLI installation instructions, please refer to the [Topaz Workbench Install Guide](https://docs.compuware.com/kb/KB2001/PDF/TopazWorkbench_Install.pdf).

## Configuring for Topaz Workbench CLI & Host Connections

In order to access zAdviser data you will need to point to an installed Topaz Workbench Command Line Interface (CLI). The Topaz Workbench CLI will work with host connection(s) you also need to configure to download zAdviser data, encrypt the data and upload to Compuware.

    - If using IFASMFDP specify an input dataset
    - DATE parameter is overridden by Jenkins parameter {zzzz} if it is specified.
    - TYPE must specify the Compuware zAdviser SMF record type, per the SMF\_ID parameter
    - The OUTDD parameter must be a temporary dataset that is passed to the ROICOPY step.
    - The //CSVOUT DD DCB attributes must not be changed.
    - If your ECC libraries are not in the LNKLIST, specify the SLCXLOAD and SLCXAUTH libraries on the //STEPLIB.

- **Unencrypted zAdviser data file** : Enter the file path to where unencrypted zAdviser data will be written.

This build action has following parameters:

- **Host connection** : Select the host connection from the **zAdviser download data and optionally upload to Compuware** build step.

![](docs/images/info.svg) To manage connections, click **Manage connections**. The **Host connections** section of the Jenkins configuration page appears allowing adding, updating, and deleting of connections.

- **zAdviser data file** : Enter the file path to where unencrypted zAdviser data will be written.

![](docs/images/info.svg) Click **Manage zAdviser API Configuration** to
update any zAdviser API configuration
items.

#### zAdviser upload to Compuware (Pipeline Script)

~~~
node {
	zAdviserUpload connectionId: \'0274970b-bade-48c1-b726-a95b84c4abbb\',
	uploadDataFile: \'encrypted.csv\'
}
~~~

## Using Pipeline Syntax to Generate Pipeline Script

- Do one of the following:

    - When working with an existing Pipeline job, click the **Pipeline Syntax** link in the left panel. The **Snippet Generator** appears.

    - When configuring a Pipeline job, click the **Pipeline Syntax** link at the bottom of the **Pipeline **configuration section. The **Snippet Generator** appears.

- **Sample Step** : Select one of the zAdviser build actions from above.

- Complete the displayed fields.

- Click **Generate Pipeline Script**. The Groovy script to invoke the step appears. The script can be added to the Pipeline section when configuring a Pipeline job. A sample script is shown below:

<img src="docs/images/pipeline.syntax.example.png" height="400"/>

## Known Limitations

-   The browser default header size may not be suitable when submitting large free-form JCL. This can be remedied by modifying the jenkins.xml file located at the root of where your Jenkins is installed. Update the jenkins.xml arguments as follows:
    - Modify the Jenkins service arguments, but adding, or changing if already present, argument: **requestHeaderSize**; a sample of the arguments is shown below:

~~~
        <arguments>-Xrs -Xmx256m -Dhudson.lifecycle=hudson
        .lifecycle.WindowsServiceLifecycle -jar "%BASE%\jenkins.war" --httpPo
        rt=8080 --webroot="%BASE%\war" --requestHeaderSize=128000</arguments>
